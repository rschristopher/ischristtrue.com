Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God
Have mercy on me, a sinner



if Christianity is true

angels are real, demons are real
satan, nephilim, the fallen

dark powers and principalities, fallen angels
allowed to rule fallen men

human souls are real and immortal

in the end, Christ will throw death and satan into the lake of fire 

kingdom of man will be antichristiam, will hate Christianity and will try to destroy Christians, even those who fall from the faith, any who still have even the scent of Christianity left on them

the world is fallen, and falling.
the world will be against Christianity as it falls.

God arises, His enemies are scattered -- the demons and dark powers are scattered, they are not in a grand hierarchy, but can only in chaos mock the true hierarchy, which they do

The corruption and the pride are out of control. The money is fake, nearly worthless, and yet here we are. 
Fake money, fiat money, is everywhere. Those closest to the money printer are not just bankers, but an entire industry of satanic pedophiles, bureaucrats laundering fiat money in an obvious attempt to destroy the world they so despise.

It's not even wealthy globalists, or rather, they never touch their own money, all of this is to profit through captured markets and cronyism.

It is so unbelievably bad that the true depth of evil cannot be comprehended.

This is the world we live in, the world that but for the grace of God would destroy itself. All of this is rebellion, rebellion against God. And all of this is permitted by God for our salvation (a testament to His patience and love for mankind), for we are made in His image and likeness.

We are image bearers of God, and yet the powers and principalities ensnare us, the rulers of the darkness of this world, spiritual wickedness in high places.

Help us, Lord, free us from all spiritual wickedness, and put all in its right place under God.

All that is good, is from God, and it is His uncreated energy.

Lord Jesus Christ
Son of God
