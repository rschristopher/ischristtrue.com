What and who is truth?

Can we know truth?





Catholic vs Orthodox, which is right?

On one hand, they can both be "right" on all the major issues of Christianity yet still be in schism.
Importantly, we as Christians cannot judge, truth is not decided by our judgement, but on His revelation and His judgment.
If "you decide" to be Catholic or Orthodox, you're choosing nihilism and not Christ. "you" do not determine truth. "you" can only rationalize beliefs. And your beliefs are irrelevant to truth, who is Christ.
We ought to discern carefully here, and we should proceed cautiously.

Are there heretical innovations that must necessarily be resolved in order to unify east and west?

the Catholic answer, is maybe, and we have an instructive case of Eastern Catholics.

the Orthodox answer, is yes, absolutely there are many heretical innovations from Rome that must be resolved in order to unify, such as:

filioque, why was it added? what heresy is this guarding against? why was it added the way it was added?

papal infallibility? it didn't exist for most of church history, everyone was wrong? what about the innovations of Vatican I, and Vatican II?

from a Catholic perspective, what would need to change about the eastern churches for them to unify? We can look at Eastern Catholics to get an idea. Not much changes, but they must grant authority to the pope, and hide what is clearly am internal division (such as we see within Catholicism right now but it never leads to schism, just protestantism).

When Orthodox churches fall out of communion, it is not hidden, and typically they unify after differences are resolved, and often with a deepening articulation of Christian faith.
The schisms are ultimately a necessary feature of the church, the means to make public all differences that must be resolved.

The goal is not vain unity, or any kind of unity, the goal is Christ. Do the divisions within Catholicism point to Christ?
Do the divisions within Orthodoxy point to Christ?
The answer, if we're being at all serious, is nuanced, and it's something like: Christ is the spirit of Truth, and He does not hide in darkness nor deceit.

if the Catholics are right, then they have to claim that the east "fell" and is in heresy -- but what did they do? what about them is heretical?
Is it that they became "stuck" in the past? Can that even be a heresy?

Why was there not a protestant reformation in the east?
Protestantism and its continual disintegration certainly seems to be the fruits of the scholastic innovations in Rome and were not seen in the east.

Lastly, if the goal is to commune with Christ, to come closer to Christ thru His church, then why innovate? Would not the apostolic tradition be paramount above all else? Why change? 
And if there is change, is that not a tacit admission that everyone who came before, every saint, was wrong or naive? And wouldn't this necessarily include Peter?
Would Peter agree with Rome's claim of the infallibility of his teaching as head of the church? Did not Paul rebuke him on his teachings?
And if infallible, why would that come later? Is the successor to Peter (not in Antioch, only his successor in Rome) only infallible in modern times?

Most important, what heresy being done by Eastern Orthodox? How are they wrong today yet right in the first thousand years of church history?

It looks an awful lot like Rome is in schism and Eastern Orthodoxy is waiting patiently, "stuck" in the past as it were, waiting and waiting for the prodigal son of Rome to return home.
