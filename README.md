<!-- Soteriology, salvation

The Augustinian error of sin as inherited guilt leads necessarily to heresy in both Roman Catholic and Reformed theological frameworks.

inevitably, one produces either
1. the immaculate conception, the belief that Mary was born without sin
2. nestorianism with iconoclasm, denial of Mary as the mother of God, and destroying images so as not to confront this fact.
