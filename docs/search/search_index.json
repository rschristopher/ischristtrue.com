As such,  many young and curious seekers of truth  approach the  fundamental questions  of life and fully expect  to find answers amongst the  philosophers  and so-called  \"intellectuals\"  of our modern age. For surely they must have answers --  these are afterall the   most fundamental questions  one could ever ask.</p> <p>Unfortunately, what we  find amongst the learned  philosophers and professional  intellectuals  is a nihilistic  program of   dead ideas,  a history of the failures   to answer  any  of the fundamental questions --  and we're left with  rationalizations and word games,  as if to  desensitize honest seekers,  to soothe them into  accepting the inevitable nihilism  that follows from not answering  the fundamental questions of life.</p> <p>Find one of these so-called  experts and ask them yourself -- Can we know anything? What does it mean to know?</p> <p>They may tell you about  epistemology,  about \"justified true belief\",  about the   Gettier problem,  and you'll find yourself  reading the likes of  Hume,  Kant,  Nietzsche,   Hegel,   Wittgenstein,  and many others. Or perhaps the absurdists like  Camus.  Or  if you have the temprament for it,  postmodernists like  Foucault. And then after a lot of study,  all you'll know is that  the mere concept of  objective truth doesn't  actually exist, or at least  is not knowable -- except  we can't even know that,  because to claim such a thing is  itself an objective truth claim.</p> <p>We now know less than we did  before we started. We could pretend everything is  rational and call ourselves  \"realists\" or  \"pragmatists\". And then like a pendulum   we could swing the other way and  embrace any of the esoteric  spiritual systems that are competing  for our attention;  transcendental  something-or-other. Maybe   Buddhists  have knowable objective truth. Or maybe one of the various  gurus  or   antigurus. Maybe we revert back to  secular liberalism, and find  ourselves yearning for the  comforts of ancient religious  beliefs that we just can't  bring ourselves to literally believe.</p> <p>For what is belief other than how  we act in the face of the  pain and suffering of life? What is it that we actually believe? And why do none of these  modern belief systems  offer any foundational answers  and always seem to bring us  further and further away  from those fundamental questions  we originally wanted to answer?</p> <p>The very nature of these questions presupposes that truth is not just facts about the way things are, but also meaning and morality about the way things should be. This is, afterall, the human condition. We ought to know something,  anything, about  our own existence.</p> <p>As the old Maori prayer goes,</p> <p>the light, the light ~ the seeking, the searching ~ in chaos, in chaos</p>"},{"location":"truth/#knowing-truth","title":"Knowing Truth","text":"<p>This should be a simple question,  is there objective knowable truth? Does truth exist?</p> <p>In our modern view,  there is no objective knowable truth. There are word games. There is a cascade of unconsciously   held beliefs behind every word,  even the word \"truth\". There is suffering. There is power and oppression. There is the deconstruction of  everything, even deconstructionism itself. Once again, our modern views move further and further  away from the fundamental questions.</p> <p>If you are at all serious about pursuing  and knowing truth,  you may want to consider an alternative  to the fashionable trends of modern  philosophy which aims  away from fundamental questions,  as if on purpose. You may want to consider that the  entire enlightenment project  has yielded exactly this assault  on the fundamental questions,  and that it is specifically   anti-Christian in  its aim: from the secular humanists  with their watered down  Christian traditions,  to the pragmatists and devout  atheists, all the way to the esoteric  spiritual revivalism that springs  forth inevitably from the  spiritually dead atheists  and the spiritually weak humanists. All of these seemingly disparate worldviews  share a singular and notable feature:  to weaken and reject Christianity,  which just so happens to be the origin   of \"knowable objective truth\". For those who still hold a belief in  knowable objective truth and yet  reject Christianity, you are operating  on the fumes of a  dead Christian worldview,  and you'll find only absurdity at the  other end of your venture.</p> <p>But what about ... ?</p> <p>You may be asking,  what about the ancient Greeks  and their concept of a divine truth, aletheia? Or what about the ancient Romans,  veritas? Or the stoics? Plato and  Aristotle  certainly had a lot to say on this matter. Or even the pre-Socratic philosophers like Parmenides. This was five-centuriess before Christ!</p> <p>Christianity must have copied   the concept of an objective  knowable truth, but they did  not invent it, right?</p> <p>Except that Veritas was a  pagan Goddess, daughter of Saturn (sometimes considered a daughter of Jupiter);  and Aletheia was a pagan Goddess, daughter of Zeus.  In some tellings she was a creation  of Prometheus --  not exactly what we mean when  talking about truth. And despite modern rationalizations, the few surviving poems from Parmenides  make this pagan worldview abundantly clear (truth was but one of many spirits and we are but playthings to the gods). Even Plato appealed to a  demiurge fashioning the platonic forms  which hardly bear a resemblance to  what we mean when talking  about objective knowable truth.</p> <p>The stoics referred to the  anima mundi and a divine logos that brought the universe into being. Aristotle recognized that a first principle of logos is necessarily unexplainable (for if a first principle had a causal explanation than that cause would be the first principle). Ultimately, these concepts, especially of logos as first principle originated from Hebrew thought (such as from the Septuagint),  which is foundational to Second-Temple Judiaism, where objective knowable truth was born (literally).</p> <p>To be clear, if you claim to be a  rationalist,  an  empiricist,  someone who follows  science  and does not believe in  anything you can't  see with your own eyes,  then you will find yourself  unmoored from any first principles  necessary for even a pretense  of objective truth, and you've  probably numbed yourself to those  fundamental questions, and perhaps   stopped asking. You can ignore the fundamental questions,  but non-belief in an otherwise \"unseen\" reality   doesn't negate the existence of that reality. You don't live in a mechanistic universe,  because fundamental questions are  not mechanistic and yet still exist  and are still fundamental. You don't live in an absurdist universe --  accepting absurdism is to  abandon reason and will. And you certainly don't live in a   postmodernist  universe.</p> <p>The postmodern \"deconstructions\" of  modern views  will yield absurdity,  but they are still apt critiques  of the prideful rationalism we see in  secular culture. There does indeed appear to be a patriarchal hierarchy  which is the foundation for any and all  objective truth claims. It indeed can't be otherwise. The patriarchy, perhaps, is real! And yet it doesn't seem to be man-made, in fact it's the fabric of reality. It's everywhere the empiricists look. On some level the postmodernists  know this, and still reject it  (and hence reject truth itself).</p> <p>They'll say, \"my truth\", \"your truth\",  because truth to them is relative,  a language game of power. Yet we can't say this without making yet  another objective truth claim. Hypocrisy would bother them if they  believed in objective truth. But really, they are assaulting the very  idea of knowable objective truth,  reducing it to self worship.</p> <p>For truth to have any meaning,  then truth must transcend all subjective  perspectives. Something is true if it is objectively true,  and knowledge of this objectivity  is what brings people to \"the Truth\".</p> <p>Modern views  frame  truth as an attribute,  that something is either true or it is not. But in practice,  truth is experienced in very personal ways,  and not at all confined to sense perceptions. We once understood this in our culture,  that truth is revealed to you personally.</p> <p>Ancient views  understood truth as a spirit,  which means Truth was  something akin to a person. If there is a spirit of truth,  then we should not just ask,  \"what is truth?\"  we should also ask  \"who is truth?\" In fact, as we shall see,  this is the only way  we can even hope to arrive  at knowable objective truth.</p> <p>John 18:38</p> <p>Pilate saith unto him, What is truth?</p>"},{"location":"truth/#spirit-of-truth","title":"Spirit of Truth","text":"<p>The spirit of truth,  like any spirit,  can be thought of as a  pattern of reality:  a pattern of reality that is as  objective as it is real  (and not  a veil of delusions  or perceptions).

It might make demands of us;  we might participate in or  be mere components of the  these spirits.

E.g., imagine (or observe) a leaf turning to face the sun; the functionality is obvious, the leaf is absorbing as much sunlight as possible. But what is the meaning and morality of a leaf turning to face the sun? The meaning is to use the sun's light to convert water into energy for the tree. The morality is that the tree is good when it does this, it flourishes with sun, and dies otherwise. And most fascinating, if you perceive one aspect of a truth claim, such as a moral intuition, you can then grasp the other attributes, including meaning. Apply this to life itself, and examine the moral intuitions of what it means to live in a way that is good, and you'll simultaneously arrive at the meaning of life.</p> <p>In our modern reductionist worldview, we often blind ourselves to revealed truths, even while our attention is captivated by, say, the beauty of a sunset, we'll fail to see the meaning.

For He is that unchangeable truth which is rightly termed \"the law of all arts, and the art of the Almighty Artificer.</p> <p>The Christian answer to Truth is,  on one hand,  an outrageous claim;  and on the other hand,  a necessary claim for  Truth to be knowable. That is, the Spirit of Truth -- God Almighty --  the creator of the universe,  was incarnate as man,  was crucified for us,  and on the third day He  rose again. Truth is the incarnate word of God, and any articulation of Truth must be revealed to you personally. Truth (the word of God) is the literal person of Christ Jesus. In other words, from mathematics to philosophy to literature, Truth in those fields is the revealed word of God, the logos made visible, who is Christ Jesus.</p> <p>And even more outrageous,  Christ is the mediator between  the transcendent and man, between God the Father and man -- and thus between  God's will and man. In other words, the creator of the  universe is knowable to you,  was born and died for you,  and is present in your every  perception, mediating   between known and unknown. As you look out onto the world,  the creator of the universe  is there with you. The source of all that is,  is with you,  making truth knowable to you.</p> <p>To be clear, there is no justifiable   epistemology outside of Christianity  and these seemingly outrageous claims  (and not surprisingly the concept of epistemology did not even exist prior to Christianity). There have been   countless attempts  (to preserve the fruit without the tree),  but all lead to nihilism,  to a rejection of knowable truth.

Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p> <p>If we are to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind then we are to give him everything that we are -- all our sins, all our talents, all our suffering, all our joys, everything.  And even how we relate to others, we are to love our neighbors as ourselves.</p> <p>St. Joseph the Hesychast</p> <p>Whatever we do not give to God to use in our ascetic struggles will be used by the other one (i.e., Satan). Our Lord gives us the commandment to love Him with all our souls and all our heart [Matthew 22:37], so that the evil one cannot find a place to rest within us.</p> <p>This may seem impossible, and that's the point, we are called to something greater than ourselves.

We obviously wanted to keep the fruits of Christendom (the morality, the epistemology, even the subordinating principle to make sense of other worldviews), but we wanted it all without God. We thought we had it. Our secular worldview has been trying to subordinate ancient worldviews, pushing them beneath our own intellect and passions. But it is failing, and nihilism has become inevitable.</p> <p>When we claim ancient worldviews are \"superstitious nonsense\", we are presupposing knowable objective truth, that we know what is and what is not truth (and thus what is nonsense).

Ironically, this nihilistic worldview has become the default worldview that our children are born into. Our culture went from no one believing nonsense to now everybody believing nonsense and trying to keep an open mind about it.</p> <p>This is why we've seen so many shallow religions in our modern culture.  We have been subordinating the ancient religious traditions of our ancestors into this nihilistic secularism.

What happens when those competing worldviews (the ancient gods) are no longer subordinated at all?</p> <p>We are living through exactly such a failure. As modernism gives way to postmodernism and nihilism, that is, the rejection of knowable objective truth, than gone too is the subordinating principle that kept those ancient worldviews bound to their respective mythology textbooks.

The first innovation of Judaism was the radical assertion that man is created in the image and likeness of the creator of the universe. This was an outrageous claim in the ancient world. Ancient worldviews understood that man was nothing to the gods but at most idle amusement, like a child playing with ants.</p> <p>The second innovation was a monotheistic God, who is transcendent to creation, and yet loves us and is knowable to us thru revelation. Those other \"gods\" we worshipped turned out to be part of creation, fallen spirits.

This is why Israel was to be a nation of priests, intended as a model for the rest of the world, a model of liberation from the \"gods\" who held dominion over us.</p> <p>These innovations spread throughout the world through Christianity, giving us a calendar system (that we take for granted), universities, hospitals, knowable objective truth, and a universal morality which includes human rights and dignity.

Masculinity is considered \"toxic\" unless it's coming from a woman, which then makes her \"brave\".  Femininity is scorned unless it's aped by a man identifying as a woman.</p> <p>To an enlightenment-era rationalist this would all seem absurd, but that's because rationalism fails to account for this very real phenomena. However, if we look to ancient worldviews then this all makes perfect sense. This absurd behavior merely reflects the ancient gender roles resurfacing, specifically where men and women become playthings of ancient \"gods\".</p> <p>We can find the \"battle of the sexes\" rhetoric emerging in the industrial revolution and in the so-called age of enlightenment. Importantly, this rhetoric did not exist in early Christianity.</p> <p>The industrial revolution increasingly took fathers out of the family business (mostly farms) and put them into factories away from home, a trend we see exacerbated during periods such as the   Great Depression   (where tractors changed the economic reality of family farms).  And as this trend continued (breaking up families) so too emerged feminist attacks on masculinity. </p> <p>Consider that every \"wave\" of feminism was preceded by erosions to the Christian family. And just as modern \"intellectuals\" explain this as progress, earlier enlightenment-era \"intellectuals\" rationalized these problems in Darwinian terms, that men had dominated women in an evolutionary game. They believed that men won the \"battle of the sexes\". But this \"battle of the sexes\" is a lose/lose game distracting us from the erosion of universal human rights.</p> <p>This ongoing breakdown of families results in the emergence of ancient gender roles.  We see today polygamy and   sneaky fuckers  and eunuchs (castrated men) and many many disposable men and women -- exactly as was the norm in the ancient world. We see abhorrent sexual behavior normalized and treated as if it's innovative and new, rather than more of the same ancient demonism.</p> <p>Moderm \"masculinity\" means to emasculate men into a pre-Christian archetype of slavish obedience to the powers and principalities ruling over us.  This in turn creates reactionary masculinity leading to unnecessary violence which only strengthens the principalities. This is clearly demonic and anti-Christian.</p> <p>Similarly, modern \"femininity\" is diminishing the value of women, paradoxically encouraging masculine energy as the only valuable energy to a woman (putting women in a decided disadvantage in the battle of the sexes they imagine themselves playing). Beauty and grace are replaced with fashion and power, ironically played out most successfully by biological men pretending to be women (further reducing the value of women such that biological men now routinely become \"woman of the year\").</p> <p>The end result of this nihilistic program is to devalue men and women back into their ancient gender roles. Rather than being made in the image and likeness of God, and to minister to one another in marriage, modern men and women are becoming as valueless as they were in the ancient world.

Which implies those rights are granted to us by the false gods (the principalities and political ideologies).

These are the ancient powers and principalities making themselves manifest for our worship, that is, principalities that we participate within.</p> <p>Let's explore some examples.</p> Kali Maa <p></p> <p>Kali is a Hindu goddess of destruction and creation. And for reasons that should surprise no one, Kali symbolism is emerging within modern western culture (which otherwise never had much Hindu influence). We see this intentionally in the Rolling Stones Logo, as well as in Jungian archetypes such as the \"devouring mother\", as well as in countless novels and comics.</p> <p>While this is arguably a perversion of orthodox Hinduism, the symbolism is clear and even western feminists are appropriating Kali Maa.</p> Ms. magazine cover in 1972 <p></p> <p>And should anyone think this is benign and some misunderstanding or misrepresentation, because obviously Kali isn't a feminist icon, here is a more recent article that makes these claims very explicit:</p> <p>Kali is the 3,000-year-old feminist icon we need today</p> <p>This makes Kali the feminist icon we need today, in that she is a complex figure of many contrasting traits, all of which are equally worthy expressions of female strength\u2014unapologetic because it doesn\u2019t even consider that there could be anything to apologise for.</p> <p>While a sincere scholar of Hinduism could say this is a blatant misunderstanding of Kali, and of course that's true in the sense that Hinduism isn't exactly feminist, but the symbolism of Kali is also very clear.  Perhaps it's the scholars that are misunderstanding Kali, especially if they can't explain why her image is suddenly so popular within modern western culture.</p> <p>Kali imagery is clearly demonic and completely unbounded by any pretense of goodness or truth. Try to articulate an honest truth claim about Kali that all cultures that worship Kali would agree with. What fruits do we see from Kali worship?</p> <p>Let's look at some other examples.</p> Ouroboros <p></p> <p>The ouroboros, that old serpent eating its own tail. We see this image throughout the ancient world, especially in ancient Egypt and Babylon. It is associated with  alchemy, such as in the mythos of Hermes Trismigestus. Which, incidentally, is also where we get Hermeticism and the modern worship of medical doctors. See the   caduceus icon, which is the staff of Hermes Trismigestus. In the caduceus the serpents are bound to the staff, explicitly breaking the ouroboros  (subordinating the serpents under a higher principle).</p> Caduceus <p></p> <p>We also see the ouroboros in ancient Christian iconography in images of Leviathan, sometimes described as the world serpent, a primordial dragon of chaos. We see the same imagery in Tiamat (Mesopotamian) and Typhon (Greek).</p> Leviathan, Behemoth, Ziz <p></p> <p>The above icon shows Leviathan in the classic ouroboros position, and also shows  Behemoth, the great primordial beast, and also Ziz, the primordial bird.</p> <p>Not all ancient images of Leviathan were as an ouroboros, sometimes Leviathan is depicted as a \"hellmouth\", literally eating damned souls. But Leviathan is universally a serpent.</p> Leviathan and Behemoth by William Blake <p></p> <p>Sometimes, as in the above William Blake artwork, an ouroboros-like motif is created using both Behemoth and Leviathan, making a kind of beastly yin-yang, contrasting order and chaos in the form of primordial beasts (note the related beasts from the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation).</p> <p>The key to understanding the ouroboros is that it represents cyclical completion.  This is a  Luciferian  worldview where creation is complete and total, self-sustaining in and of itself, requiring no external creator (neither essence nor energy), that nothing is uncreated. The serpent in an ouroboros is sufficient in and of itself (needing nothing else).</p> <p>Not only do we see ouroboros iconography resurging in modern culture, it is part of a broader Luciferian resurgence. Here's an explicit example from 1971,</p> <p>Saul Alinsky, Rules for Radicals, 1971</p> <p>Lest we forget at least an over-the-shoulder acknowledgment to the very first radical: from all our legends, mythology, and history (and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins or which is which), the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom \u2013 Lucifer</p> <p>An easy way to understand serpent iconography is as primordial chaos, and when in an ouroboros position it is explicitly Luciferian, or at least trying to be. Contrast this with the broken ouroboros imagery where there's a higher ordering principle touching heaven, typically a staff (such as the staff of Moses in Exodus, or the staff of Hermes Trismigestus) but also the cross where Christ is as the serpent, explicitly breaking the ouroboros in the cross and putting the serpent in its place under a divine ordering principle.</p> <p>And finally there's the original Luciferian serpent imagery (ouroboros or otherwise), \"that old serpent\" himself, Satan.</p> Satan <p></p> <p>From an artistic perspective, modern use of satanic imagery has become so common as to become dull and hackneyed. It has become so predictable and ubiquitous in our culture that you're almost surprised when modern art or a music video doesn't feature explicit satanic imagery. When not using explicit imagery, the themes of modern film and television often promote Luciferian themes: \"you can be anything you want\", \"the power was in you all along\", \"you just need to believe in yourself\", and so on.</p> <p>The list of ancient \"gods\" (Satan included) seems endless, and in all you'll find deceit and confusion  -- such as with Kali or Satan or the many inversions such as the Prometheus mythology. When you try to pin down an objective truth claim (what is its exact meaning and purpose?) you'll never really get a complete answer,  but always vague inferences as if they're approaching an answer that is forever out of reach:  themes of power and influence, order out of chaos, destructive revolutions, etc. You'll get a snake eating its own tail.</p> <p>And to be clear, these are the ancient \"gods\" in all their deceitful glory.  There is never objective knowable truth when dealing with them, never explicit meaning or answers to the fundamental questions. This is the case whether you're studying Jungian archetypes, or attempting to worship pagan gods directly, or indirectly as in the modern worldview.

Typically there were rebellions amongst the gods, and often divine knowledge was given to man by some rebellious character, allowing man to have technology and civilization.</p> <p>The innovation in Judiaism is the realization (revelation) that the God most high is uncreated, and not only the creator of all, but also the source of morality, a universal morality, that good and evil are objectively knowable. As such only the God most high is to be worshipped. Contrast this with the Roman pantheon, where the gods of conquered people were collected and worshipped.</p> <p>Within pagan mythologies you'll even find stories of a great flood, lost civilizations, and even some heavenly rebellions -- although interestingly, the pagan gods all succeded in their rebellions: Zeus overthrew his father Cronus, who had in turn castrated his father Heaven (Uranus); Kumarbi overthrew Anu (biting off his genitals); Set killed his brother Osiris, the perfect pharoah; and then Horus, the son of Osiris, overthrows Set. In some cases there are cyclical dieties, where the rebellious succession repeats in a cycle (such as the trimurti in Hinduism).</p> <p>In all of these systems we have angelic spirits and demonic counterparts: from the Aztec Tzitzimitl to the Japanese Oni.</p> <p>Deuteronomy 32:16-17</p> <p>They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.

This was the universal backdrop of idol worship, and God worked through His chosen people and transformed this abhorrent practice from within, first into mediated communion in the Tabernacle, and then eventually into the life of Christ Jesus.</p> <p>Graven Images</p> <p>The Hebrew word pesel (\u05e4\u05e1\u05dc) is used in Exodus 20:4 (and related passages), referring to a carved statue that is worshipped. Additionally, temunah (\u05ea\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4) is referring to a likeness or similitude.</p> <p>Let's look carefully at the second of the ten commandments, the prohibition of graven images:</p> <p>Exodus 20:4-5</p> <p>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image (pesel), or any likeness (temunah) of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:  Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.</p> <p>God commanded the Israelites not to make images of spiritual things and worship them (which they immediately did anyway). And this of course follows the first commandment to have no other gods before Him. The Levitical laws further refined this command with reference to idols:</p> <p>Leviticus 19:4</p> <p>Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.</p> <p>Importantly, idols are differentiated here from \"molten gods\", such that we see the beginning of a broad category known as idolatry -- which can be further refined in the New Testament:</p> <p>1 Corinthians 10:14-22</p> <p>Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.  I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.  The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread. </p> <p>Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?  What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?  But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.  Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils.  Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?</p> <p>Note how the sacrifice of Christ and His body and blood are compared to the pagan sacrifices to idols.</p> <p>Colossians 3:2-8</p> <p>Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.  For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.  When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</p> <p>Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: </p> <p>For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:  In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.  But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</p> <p>There is a clear understanding that idolatry is anything valued above God, not just images but anything that is not Christ Jesus:</p> <p>1 John 5:19-21</p> <p>And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.  And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.</p> <p>Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.</p> <p>The Mosaic law rightly forbids man-made graven images, \"molten gods\" such as the golden calf. That kind of idol worship was a near universal practice in the ancient world. Christ elevated this prohibition of idol worship to anything outside of Himself, perfectly expressed in the greatest commandment to love God with all your heart, mind, and soul. We are to worship the one true God, the only begotten Son of God, the word made flesh, and not idols.</p> <p>Isaiah 42:17</p> <p>They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.</p> <p>Christ is the image and also the sacrifice -- no molten idol can contain the Son of God -- but man was made in the image and likeness of God, thus the living God became a living icon (a man without sin), who is the sacrifice for our salvation.</p> <p>The life of Christ is a clear testament to why we cannot worship \"molten gods\" or \"graven images\", for we are created in the image and likeness of the one true God and cannot worship anything that is beneath us, and as Christ ascended as a man into heaven, so we have only Christ Jesus to worship -- there is nothing higher for us to worship.</p>"},{"location":"ancient-views/iconoclasm/#icons-images","title":"Icons (Images)","text":"<p>Literally, image: an icon is any kind of image. Importantly, images in the ancient world were not benign nor mundane like they are today. Images were and are powerful. Images were deeply sacred, or as in the case of idols, deeply sacrilegious and heretical.  The concept of an image is in fact so important that our very creation was in the \"image and likeness of God\".</p> <p>Image and Likeness</p> <p>Icon is from the Greek \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u1f7c\u03bd (eik\u014dn), literally \"image\". The Hebrew is tselem (\u05e6\u05dc\u05dd) as in \"in the image of God\". And relatedly demut (\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05ea) as in \"likeness of God\".</p> <p>We often refer to icons as specific religious images, but it is a general term (sacred or profane or otherwise). If an icon becomes an object of worship, such as a pagan idol (graven image), then this is idolatry. And because imaging is so fundamental to our being, image-based idolatry is so dangerous.</p> <p>In terms of sacred icons, here is perhaps the most important and sacred use of an \"image\" (icon):</p> <p>Genesis 1:26</p> <p>And God said, Let us make man in our image (tselem), after our likeness (demut): and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</p> <p>Images are not just important but they are the most important power at our disposal (because we are made in the image of God). And contrary to the sacrilegious golden calf that Moses destroyed, images were used in the most sacred places, such as the icons of gold cherubims protecting the ark of the covenant:</p> <p>Exodus 25:18-21</p> <p>And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.  And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof.  And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.  And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.</p> <p>The sacred icons in the Tabernacle are another good example:</p> <p>Exodus 26:1</p> <p>Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.</p> <p>And when the second temple was built, it was adorned with icons big and small:</p> <p>1 Kings 6:23-28</p> <p>And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.  And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.  And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.  The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.  And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.  And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</p> <p>Note that cherubim were the highest of the heavenly hosts, and the most sacred created being in heaven one could make into an icon (but never as idol, never to worship). Even the prophecied temple in Ezekiel's vision contained cherub icons:</p> <p>Ezekiel 41:18-19</p> <p>And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;  So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about.</p> <p>It is clear that images were sometimes idolatrous, like the golden calf -- and sometimes sacred, like the golden cherubims. Importantly, images were never mundane. Any icon, including your fellow human beings, should never be worshipped, but they can be honored and respected (venerated).</p>"},{"location":"ancient-views/iconoclasm/#icons-are-not-idols","title":"Icons are not Idols","text":"<p>It is clear from scripture that icons are not idols (although some idols are of course images), and further, veneration is not the same as worship.

Icons and Idols are two very different categories, and while there exists an intersection (graven images), we should never confuse idols and icons.</p> <p>Remember, we are created in the image and likeness of God. We ourselves are icons of God. The ancient Hebrew words for \"image and likeness\" are distinct from the prohibited \"graven image\" in the ten commandments, which refers directly to the worship of the idols of false gods. Conflating icons with idols is dangerous and heretical (see anathema below).</p> <p>This categorical distinction of idols and icons is not only obvious but it is also inevitable and inescapable. We cannot rid ourselves of iconographic symbolism and still worship a transcendent God (we are ourselves icons of that transcendent God). Any attempt to glorify God necessitates symbolism (in image or action or word). Iconographic symbolism will happen no matter how much we suppress or destroy sacred images.</p> <p>Destroying images does not remove man-made images. The result is never \"no image\". The result is ugly, bland, industrial images in what was supposed to be a sacred place (the church).

The Tabernacle was adorned with golden cherubims for a reason. And there was a reason Moses ground up the golden calf into powder, sprinkled it into water, and forced the idolatrous Israelites to drink (water here symbolizes precosmogonic chaos). Moses attacked the idol itself, not the very concept of images (which were obviously necessary in the Tabernacle).</p> <p>Just like \"nothing is not a reference point\", nothing is not an image that clears a path for communion with God. Destroying images results in images of bland brokenness and not nothingness. And if the goal is truly nothingness, then it is nihilism and not Christ that iconoclasts are worshipping.</p> <p>To explain this in metaphysical language: the finite cannot touch the infinite, the created cannot touch the uncreated -- a mediator is required -- the uncreated infinite must descend down into the created finite and express itself through created forms, that is, through icons (of which Christ is the alpha and the omega).</p>"},{"location":"ancient-views/iconoclasm/#veneration-is-not-worship","title":"Veneration is not Worship","text":"<p>What we worship inevitably determines what we venerate.

We all worship, and our actions and words will reveal what it is we are really worshipping.</p> How are icons venerated? <p>In Orthodox churches, icons are venerated by bowing and kissing, exactly as people in ancient cultures greeted one another. In this case, Christians bow to and kiss icons as if greeting a close friend. Despite the modern aversion, kissing as a greeting was the norm in early Christianity (see Romans 16:16). And notice how the most secular cultures are the most averse to kissing as a greeting.</p> <p>Worshipping physical icons would of course be wrong (and somewhat absurd in our modern age).

In other words, iconoclasts have been expelled from the church, the body of Christ, unless and until they repent.</p> <p>Ultimately, iconoclasts impede us from expressing our worship of God (worship of truth) -- effectively removing the primary means (imaging) of expressing our worship of God, confining how we worship -- making us vulnerable to image-based idolatry (such as pornography or politics). The bad fruits of iconoclastic churches demonstrate exactly this: they are not just ugly, but will inevitably produce a bland faith, where God becomes a lesser concern in people's daily life (such as giving God only an hour on Sunday).</p> <p>It is difficult in our  modern view  to understand the importance of religious icons.

Most protestants will reject this and ask, \"why not pray directly to Christ?\"</p> <p>Obviously one should pray to Christ, but we should also pray for others (what are known as intercessory prayers) and ask others to pray for us. The reasons for intercessory prayes are many, and the protestant belief seems to be that only people living in the world can do intercessory prayers, and otherwise there's no living spirits who can intercede (which is a nihilistic view and should be rejected on those terms alone).</p> <p>Ultimately, Christ has a human and divine will, being both God and man -- and it is from Mary that Christ gets His humanity. The Orthodox view is that Mary is alive with her Son and is very much able to hear and respond to prayer requests. Intercessions from Mary are a way to connect directly to Christ's humanity.</p> <p>As has been the tradition for two thousand years, we honor and respect icons of the Theotokos because she is the human mother of Christ. We ought never to destroy nor suppress such images.</p>"},{"location":"ancient-views/iconoclasm/#icons-of-saints","title":"Icons of Saints","text":"<p>Similar to the icons of Mary, venerating saints often involves intercessory prayers from those saints. The orthodox view is that the saints and the angels are praying for you, and by venerating an icon you are participating in the spirit of that saint or angel, opening yourself to them, which could be as simple as gaining inspiration from their life story, such as their deep humility or in their struggles with sin and their salvation in Christ.</p> <p>Here are a few informative examples of icons of saints:</p> Sts. Paul and Peter <p></p> <p>We see in this icon the spread of Christianity, the spread of Christ's church through the missions of Sts. Paul and Peter, reaching to the Gentiles and to the Jews alike. It is a mission that continues very much to this day.</p> The Good Thief in Paradise <p></p> <p>One of my favorite icons is the traditional depiction of the good (or penitent) thief who was crucified alongside Christ. He is traditionally depicted as carrying his cross everywhere he goes, and as such stands out in any of the icons where he appears.</p> <p>Very little is known of this man, other than the what is written in Luke 23:39-43, including the merciful words from Christ, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.</p> <p>Importantly, the good thief repented and turned to Christ, recognizing Jesus as the Messiah, but also this thief rebuked a sinner (the other criminal who hurled insults at Christ). In doing so this thief confessed his own sins, stating that his punishment is just. And most importantly, he experienced a baptismal death (the old man died and the new man was born into Christ). The entirety of Christian salvation is captured in this very short story (baptism, justification, redemption, confession, and even theosis).</p> John the Baptist <p></p> <p>This is another uniquely recognizable icon. John the Baptist is traditionally depicted with wings and holding his severed head. This is an example of how orthodox icons emphasize symbolic meaning over candid realism.</p> Parable of the Good Samaritan <p></p> <p>In this icon we have the parable of the good Samaritan. The parable itself is depicted, not a named saint, although in Christ's telling of this parable he seemed to be referring to an actual event (of a man traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho).</p> <p>Venerating this icon is to venerate the very words of Christ, as well as venerating the good Samaritan and appealing to the spirit of the good Samaritan for help and intercession.</p>"},{"location":"ancient-views/mediation/","title":"Mediaton","text":"<p>For there is one God and one Mediator  between God and men,  the Man Christ Jesus,  (1 Tim. 2:5)</p> <p>https://blogs.ancientfaith.com/glory2godforallthings/2020/02/15/the-one-mediator-and-the-sacraments/</p> <p>Christ mediates between us and  God the Father.

Or at least that's how it's referred to in our modern secular view, which can feel a bit dry and lifeless unless we really think about it what is actually happening. Closer approximations in modern vernacular might be something \"that blew my mind\" or a \"raising of consciousness\" amongst the new age folks who like to read Carl Jung. But really nothing in our modern speech comes close to the true meaning of metanoia.</p> <p>The etymology points to the Greek, meta- meaning change, and -noia from nous which is best understood as the faculty of mind that determines what is true or real. Thus it is a change of mind in the deepest possible sense, not just what you think is true, but a change to the very faculty of how you know what is true.</p> <p>Perhaps the closest we have today is in movies like the matrix or any state of waking up from a false worldview into something irrefutably true, where the old worldview dissolves like a bad dream.</p> <p>Think of a dream that seemed completely real, and only later, when you wake up for real do you finally come to your senses -- such an experience is metanoia. It is radical transformation from one worldview into another. To get the beam out of your own eye, that is metanoia.</p> <p>Ancient Christians (and modern orthodox Christians) use this word to describe conversion. And this is because conversion to Christianity involves a radical change in one's heart, soul, and mind. One's nous opens into a relationship with the creator of the universe , the sprit of truth, which is Christ, and one develops an orthodox Christian phronema, the first step to theosis, of becoming like Christ.</p> <p>One of the most interesting uses of metanoia is the words of John the Baptist, where \"metanoeite\" is translated as \"repent\".</p> John the Baptist <p>\u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b5\u00b7 \u1f24\u03b3\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03bd \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u1f21 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u1ff6\u03bd.</p> <p>Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!</p> <p></p> <p>One cannot repent while in a relativistic worldview. The conditions for repentance, for metanoia, require objectively knowable  truth, universal morality, as well as the ability to discern good from evil.</p> <p>In fact, Orthodox Christianity is unlike any other religion or worldview in that it is a continuously deepening repentance, a continuous metanoia.</p> <p>axiom</p> <p>first principles</p> <p>root cause</p> <p>necessarily taken on faith, for if there was a cause of a first principle, that cause would be the first principle </p> <p>Jonathan Swift</p> <p>Reasoning will never make a Man correct an ill Opinion, which by Reasoning he never acquired</p> <p>Or as it's usually paraphrased, </p> <p>You Cannot Reason People Out of Something They Were Not Reasoned Into</p> <p>We can see here a clear example of the enlightenment mistake, the unquestioned belief in reason itself as a first principle. To put it succinctly, ones belief in reason cannot be reasoned into (thus people will abandon reason, without good reason).</p> <p>Schopenhauer provides a more refined example of this mistake, </p> <p>Schopenhauer</p> <p>Founders of religion and philosophers come into the world to shake them out of their lethargy and to point out the lofty meaning of existence; philosophers for the few, the exempt; founders of religion for the many, for humanity on a large scale. For \u2018it is impossible for the broad masses to be philosophically educated\u2019, as even your Plato said, and you should not forget. Religion is the metaphysics of the people, which we must absolutely allow them and therefore outwardly respect; for to discredit it means to deprive them of it.</p> <p>Notice the Satanic presuppositions here, common in academic philosophy, that they are \"the few\", the philosopher kings that \"allow\" the broad masses to have their religion, that the philosopher kings should \"outwardly respect\" these religions even though they could discredit them. Apparently Christianity only survived because academic philosophers allowed it. What pride!</p> <p>This remains a common view amongst overly educated academics, who believe they have discovered a deeper truth, something more true, more fundamental than the layman who fumbles with his crude religion.</p> <p>Yet ask the enlightened philosopher, the so-called lover of wisdom, what is the meaning and purpose of existence?</p> <p>They will flounder and flail, wandering away from Christ, in a pitiable and predictable nihilistic path towards relativism. Once you see it you cannot unsee it. The entire field of philosophy as we understand it comes crashing down.</p> <p>This is because they have no deeper truth, no first principle as a cause for their belief in reason, knowledge, and even truth itself.  They must accept all these secondary causes as primary, and somehow attempt to weave multiple axioms into a unified principle: ethics, epistemology, mathematics, beauty, art, ..., the list goes on. </p> <p>Reason is not self justifying, and can provide no defensible epistemology, let alone an ethic. </p> <p>Faith in reason is a form of self worship, imagining ourselves as unbiased observers of an objectively knowable existence and that we can reason our way to knowledge and truth. That we and our capacity to reason and observe evidence is the source of all knowledge, morality, beauty, etc.</p> <p>To connect to a deeper first principle is metanoia, the revelation of such a first cause. This cause will become the new first principle.</p> <p>And in terms of reason, from where does it arise? Where does reason come from?</p> <p>And what about morality? Or even mathematics? Or beauty?</p> <p>Are these all first principles that we must accept on faith? Or is there a deeper and unifying first principle? A unified first principle? A first principle that when accepted will be the final moment of metanoia.</p> <p>For just as there must be faith in first principles, there is necessarily a final unified first principle. It is that which we take on faith and which is the causal source of knowledge, morality, beauty, truth, mathematics, and even reason itself.</p> <p>We all necessarily have faith in a unified first principle, that which (we believe) gives rise to knowledge, morality, beauty, truth, etc. We attempt to answer with nothingness in our modern view, that is, a worship of nothingness.</p> <p>Christ shows us otherwise. And we must repent, continually in an ever deepening metanoia -- in order to commune with Him.</p>"},{"location":"ancient-views/mysteries/","title":"The Holy Mysteries","text":"<p>http://www.crivoice.org/creeddositheus.html</p> <p>Sacraments, evangelical mysteries</p> <p>And the Mysteries consist of  something natural,  and of something supernatural;  and are not bare signs of the promises of God.

For example, the so-called deutero-Isaiah (second Isaiah) theory holds that Isaiah 1-39 was written separately from Isaiah 40-66,  and there's even a trito-Isaiah theory suggesting that Isaiah 56-66 is from a 3rd author.</p> <p>Importantly, there's no evidence for multiple authors and this is entirely a modern speculation based on \"textual criticism\",  which is to suggest that there's a different writing style in these sections. Let's examine two passages from these different \"styles\":</p> <p>Isaiah 6:10 | Isaiah 53:1</p> <p>\u201cMake the heart of this people dull, And their ears heavy,  And shut their eyes; Lest they see with their eyes, And hear with their ears,  And understand with their heart, And return and be healed.\u201d</p> <p>Who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?</p> <p>The conjecture is that these were written centuries apart and by different authors and to different audiences. However, this contradicts the witness of both scripture and tradition.</p> <p>John 12:37-41</p> <p>But although He had done so many signs before them, they did not believe in Him, that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke:</p> <p>\u201cLord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\u201d</p> <p>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:</p> <p>\u201cHe has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, Lest they should see with their eyes, Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, So that I should heal them.\"</p> <p>These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.</p> <p>Thr gospel of John confirms it was the same Isaiah, as he quotes from what we call Isaiah 6 and from Isaiah 53, and John connects them with \"because Isaiah said again\", referring clearly to the same person and not the \"Book of Isaiah\".</p> <p>Textual criticism that yields wild speculations based on no evidence is likely pointing towards heresy.</p> <p>To be clear, there is no evidence and only a modern interpretation of Isaiah to back the notion of multiple authors. The argument is essentially that the \"tone\" of the earlier sections of Isaiah are different than the later sections, that Isaiah 40-66 is being written to a different audience, specifically to the Jewish diaspora under Babylonian exile. This view does not hold up under scrutiny as earlier sections of Isaiah also use the same prophetic tone, such as in Isaiah 6. And clearly the prophecies are written to a much broader audience, including those at the time of Christ and well after.</p> <p>Famously, Isaiah 53 makes a clear prophecy with a unique \"tone\" that is clearly referring to Christ,  and it refers to Christ as if those events had already happened. Christ did not arise and ascend during Babylonian exile.  The audience for these sections of Isaiah is clearly not specific to Babylonian exile, and in fact the timeline is woven together.</p> <p>Additionally, there are no ancient copies of Isaiah that stopped at Isaiah 39, which would be an abrupt and awkward stopping place in any age. The evidence points to the contrary, that what we call Isaiah 40-66 was present during the life of the prophet Isaiah. The oldest surviving copy of Isaiah is from the dead sea scrolls and it includes the entirety of what today is Isaiah 1 through 66. There was no seperation between Isaiah 39 and 40, in fact, the partitioning that existed connected 39 and 40 as if they were in the same section. A competent \"textual critic\" would notice this with even a cursory read:</p> <p>Isaiah 39:5-8 - 40:1-5</p> <p>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, \"Hear the word of the Lord of hosts: 'Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and what your fathers have accumulated until this day, shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left,' says the Lord. 'And they shall take away some of your sons who will descend from you, whom you will beget; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.' \" So Hezekiah said to Isaiah, \u201cThe word of the Lord which you have spoken is good!\u201d For he said, \u201cAt least there will be peace and truth in my days.\u201d</p> <p>\"Comfort, yes, comfort My people!\" Says your God. \"Speak comfort to Jerusalem, and cry out to her, That her warfare is ended, That her iniquity is pardoned; For she has received from the Lord\u2019s hand Double for all her sins.\" </p> <p>The voice of one crying in the wilderness: \"Prepare the way of the Lord; Make straight in the desert A highway for our God. Every valley shall be exalted And every mountain and hill brought low; The crooked places shall be made straight And the rough places smooth; The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, And all flesh shall see it together; For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.\"</p> <p>Clearly, Isaiah 39 does not present a logical ending to Isaiah's prophecy, and in fact the text flows beautifully into the Lord promising comfort from which the stage is set for John the Baptist and the coming of Christ Jesus. Ancient commentaries from the early church fathers make it clear that Isaiah is to be understood holistically  and not piecemeal with different audiences specific to different time periods.</p> <p>Why would this matter? And why would it be heretical to assume multiple authors?</p> <p>Breaking Isaiah into different authors forces a context that is otherwise not present;  it forces us to imagine that Israel before the Babylonian exile had no access to Isaiah 40-66,  which significantly narrows the scope of Isaiah 1-39 (where the pre-incarnate Christ is introduced). By this \"textual criticism\", the prophecied figure of Christ in Isaiah 53 was only made within the narrow context of Israel living under Babylonian exile.</p> <p>Multiple authors gives way to eisegetical interpretations, where the \"suffering servant\" becomes a new and even abstract character introduced by later authors, rather than the person Isaiah saw on the throne in Isaiah 6. This eisegesis (intentionally or otherwise) obscures the text and breaks the continuity of God from the Old Testament, with Christ (God in the New Testament). This heretical view can be refuted by Christ's own words in John as well as by church tradition.</p> <p>Ultimately, truth is Christ Jesus, the alpha and the omega, not the heretic musings  and \"textual criticism\" from scholars under the sway of the spirit of antichrist (well-intentioned or otherwise).</p>"},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#jeremiah","title":"Jeremiah","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#ezekiel","title":"Ezekiel","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#daniel","title":"Daniel","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#book-of-the-twelve","title":"Book of the Twelve","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#hosea","title":"Hosea","text":"<p>Hosea 6:2</p> <p>After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</p>"},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#joel","title":"Joel","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#amos","title":"Amos","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#obadiah","title":"Obadiah","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#jonah","title":"Jonah","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#micah","title":"Micah","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#nahum","title":"Nahum","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#habakkuk","title":"Habakkuk","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#zephaniah","title":"Zephaniah","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#haggai","title":"Haggai","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#zechariah","title":"Zechariah","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/prophecy/#malachi","title":"Malachi","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/redemption/","title":"Redemption of Man","text":"<p>To redeem is to buy back, from the Latin redimere, literally again-buy. In the ancient Greek, it is apolytr\u014dsis meaning to ransom in full.</p> <p>Titus 11:14</p> <p>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,  Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;  Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;  Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p> <p>Luke 21:28</p> <p>And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.</p> <p>While our modern view of redemption is that Christ died for our sins, for the wages of sin are death -- the ancient view went far deeper. In the fall of man, there were multiple rebellions where man turned away from God, his creator. Redemption is the act of God that buys us back, bringing us back under God, fulfilling what we were created to fulfill -- that is, to glorify God.</p> <p>Redemption effectively undoes the three cosmological rebellions against God:</p> <ol> <li>exile from Eden, introducing death to creation </li> <li>sin, starting with Cain and then leading to the flood, God taking HisSpirit away from man, limiting our lives to no more than a hundred and twenty years</li> <li>Babel, scattering us across the earth and confusing our language such that we no longer speak the divine language</li> </ol> <p>Importantly, each of these moments resulted in a change in cosmology, that is, the very nature of reality and the order of creation shifted. It is thus a mistake when we imagine our modern cosmology applied to earlier eras -- in truth the very fabric of reality was different.</p> <p>The most extreme example was life without death. But even in the days after Noah and prior to Babel, all men spoke the same language and \"nothing was impossible\" to man.  There was no \"language learning\" nor even such a concept.  There was no miscommunication.  Language conveyed unambiguous meaning to all. Additionally, this was prior to the new covenant and as such God's moral law was not yet written into the hearts of man. We cannot imagine what life was like in this era, as our entire conscious mind is based on a different cosmology. We can only infer from ancient text (canonical and apocryphal) what this was like -- e.g., to be placed beneath the gods (spirits), to be subject to demons, playthings of devils. For better or worse, our modern age is increasingly providing a taste of exactly this ungodly state.</p> <p>The redemption of man is thus an extreme cosmological shift, a paradigm shift in consciousness, restoring man into a state last seen in Eden. For others this is hell, which is God's mercy for the unrepentant.</p> <p>John 12:31</p> <p>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</p> <p>In other words, all are bought back, and while this is good news for those who bear their cross so that the old man may die, this exact redemption (buying back) is a lake of fire for those that refuse to let the old man die. This means there is no more rebellion, that time as we know it is over, and we return to our created state -- glorified, or thrown into the lake of fire. Importantly, this was understood as the exact same phenomena -- to the repentant it is divine glory, beholding the face of God, to the unrepentant it is fire, it is weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p> <p>Hell is thus not the lake of fire. The fire is the divine light of God; the uncreated energy of God. Hell is outer darkness away from God, a mercy to those who refuse God's grace, for to be in the presence of God would be unbearable pain to those holding onto sin.</p>"},{"location":"ancient-views/salvation/","title":"Salvation","text":"<p>not legalistic</p> <p>it is a process, a healing</p> <p>becoming like Christ (theosis)</p> <p>Soteriology</p> <p>The Augustinian error of sin as inherited guilt leads necessarily to heresy in both Roman Catholic and Reformed theological frameworks.</p> <p>inevitably, one produces either 1. the immaculate conception, the belief that Mary was born without sin 2. nestorianism with iconoclasm, denial of Mary as the mother of God, and destroying images so as not to confront this fact.</p> <p>The Theotokos in a vision to Elder Anthimos</p> <p>Those who struggle for Christ not only have a great reward, but even their sweat will be considered as the blood of martyrs on the Day of Judgment </p> <p>Blessed Synkletike</p> <p>Those who begin life in God encounter much toil and suffering in the beginning; afterwards they find indescribable joy.</p> <p>St. Cyril of Jerusalem</p> <p>Take courage, toil and strive zealously, for nothing will be lost.

And these no one will gainsay \u2014 no one, at all events, who is even moderately versed in the institutions of the Church. For were we to attempt to reject such customs as have no written authority, on the ground that the importance they possess is small, we should unintentionally injure the Gospel in its very vitals; or, rather, should make our public definition a mere phrase and nothing more.</p> <p>For instance, to take the first and most general example, who is thence who has taught us in writing to sign with the sign of the cross those who have trusted in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ?</p> <p>What writing has taught us to turn to the East at the prayer?</p> <p>Which of the saints has left us in writing the words of the invocation at the displaying of the bread of the Eucharist and the cup of blessing? For we are not, as is well known, content with what the apostle or the Gospel has recorded, but both in preface and conclusion we add other words as being of great importance to the validity of the ministry, and these we derive from unwritten teaching.</p> <p>Moreover we bless the water of baptism and the oil of the chrism, and besides this the catechumen who is being baptized. On what written authority do we do this? Is not our authority silent and mystical tradition? Nay, by what written word is the anointing of oil itself taught? And whence comes the custom of baptizing thrice? And as to the other customs of baptism from what Scripture do we derive the renunciation of Satan and his angels?</p> <p>Does not this come from that unpublished and secret teaching which our fathers guarded in a silence out of the reach of curious meddling and inquisitive investigation?Well had they learned the lesson that the awful dignity of the mysteries is best preserved by silence. What the uninitiated are not even allowed to look at was hardly likely to be publicly paraded about in written documents. What was the meaning of the mighty Moses in not making all the parts of the tabernacle open to every one? The profane he stationed without the sacred barriers; the first courts he conceded to the purer; the Levites alone he judged worthy of being servants of the Deity; sacrifices and burnt offerings and the rest of the priestly functions he allotted to the priests; one chosen out of all he admitted to the shrine, and even this one not always but on only one day in the year, and of this one day a time was fixed for his entry so that he might gaze on the Holy of Holies amazed at the strangeness and novelty of the sight. Moses was wise enough to know that contempt stretches to the trite and to the obvious, while a keen interest is naturally associated with the unusual and the unfamiliar.</p> <p>In the same manner the Apostles and Fathers who laid down laws for the Church from the beginning thus guarded the awful dignity of the mysteries in secrecy and silence, for what is bruited abroad random among the common folk is no mystery at all. This is the reason for our tradition of unwritten precepts and practices, that the knowledge of our dogmas may not become neglected and contemned by the multitude through familiarity.</p> <p>Dogma and Kerugma are two distinct things; the former is observed in silence; the latter is proclaimed to all the world. One form of this silence is the obscurity employed in Scripture, which makes the meaning of dogmas difficult to be understood for the very advantage of the reader: Thus we all look to the East at our prayers, but few of us know that we are seeking our own old country, Paradise, which God planted in Eden in the East. Genesis 2:8</p> <p>We pray standing, on the first day of the week, but we do not all know the reason. On the day of the resurrection (or standing again Grk. \u1f00 \u03bd\u1f71\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) we remind ourselves of the grace given to us by standing at prayer, not only because we rose with Christ, and are bound to seek those things which are above, Colossians 3:1 but because the day seems to us to be in some sense an image of the age which we expect, wherefore, though it is the beginning of days, it is not called by Moses first, but one. For he says There was evening, and there was morning, one day, as though the same day often recurred. Now one and eighth are the same, in itself distinctly indicating that really one and eighth of which the Psalmist makes mention in certain titles of the Psalms, the state which follows after this present time, the day which knows no waning or eventide, and no successor, that age which ends not or grows old. Of necessity, then, the church teaches her own foster children to offer their prayers on that day standing, to the end that through continual reminder of the endless life we may not neglect to make provision for our removal there.</p> <p>Moreover all Pentecost is a reminder of the resurrection expected in the age to come. For that one and first day, if seven times multiplied by seven, completes the seven weeks of the holy Pentecost; for, beginning at the first, Pentecost ends with the same, making fifty revolutions through the like intervening days. And so it is a likeness of eternity, beginning as it does and ending, as in a circling course, at the same point. On this day the rules of the church have educated us to prefer the upright attitude of prayer, for by their plain reminder they, as it were, make our mind to dwell no longer in the present but in the future. Moreover every time we fall upon our knees and rise from off them we show by the very deed that by our sin we fell down to earth, and by the loving kindness of our Creator were called back to heaven.</p> <p>67</p> <p>Time will fail me if I attempt to recount the unwritten mysteries of the Church. Of the rest I say nothing; but of the very confession of our faith in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, what is the written source? If it be granted that, as we are baptized, so also under the obligation to believe, we make our confession in like terms as our baptism, in accordance with the tradition of our baptism and in conformity with the principles of true religion, let our opponents grant us too the right to be as consistent in our ascription of glory as in our confession of faith. If they deprecate our doxology on the ground that it lacks written authority, let them give us the written evidence for the confession of our faith and the other matters which we have enumerated. While the unwritten traditions are so many, and their bearing on the mystery of godliness 1 Timothy 3:16 is so important, can they refuse to allow us a single word which has come down to us from the Fathers;\u2014 which we found, derived from untutored custom, abiding in unperverted churches;\u2014 a word for which the arguments are strong, and which contributes in no small degree to the completeness of the force of the mystery?</p> <p>St Basil the Great \u201cOn the Holy Spirit,\u201d Chapter 27, https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3203.htm</p>"},{"location":"logos/","title":"Logos","text":"<p>Logos (\u039b\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2) means literally the Word of God.

Note these same \"intellectuals\"  will take seriously   trans-hunanist  arguments  and want to \"upload\" their consciousness  into a machine.</p> <p>Truth is, Christians fear immortality,  because they fear God -- they fear  the judgment that is due. Because they know, deep down, that they  are unworthy of His grace. And that only through the intercession  of Christ will they receive salvation.</p> <p>As much as some pious half-hearted  Christians imagine themselves as already  saved, deep down they know,  that it was us  who crucified the Son of God. The creator of the universe became man,  and we killed him. And let's be clear, the creator of  the universe didn't just appear as   a symbol, but became man --  the totality of God fit within  a single human being. For we were created in the image  and likeness of God.</p> <p>A single human life is worth more to God  than the entire cosmos. The essence of God cannot be contained  in all of the stars in existence,  let alone the person of God. And yet, there He was. The creator of all, born in a manger.</p> <p>The human soul is immortal, and even after the fall, we retain an immortal soul. We once beheld the face of God,  and we shone with His radiance,  with no shame or vulnerability in  our being. It is after the fall, turning away  from God, did we see our material  bodily nature, our vulnerability,  our nakedness. And in our sin of pride, of wanting  to be as God,  was death set upon creation.</p> <p>And so, what happens to such exalted  creatures, made in the image and likeness  of God, when we die? Nothingness? This is the longing of the atheist -- because the alternative is too frightful to bear. For if God is real, then man's soul   is immortal,  and by not accepting salvation,  salvation  which is freely given, how will  such a soul respond to eternity  without God to sustain them? They will seek the cold nothingness,  for the alternative is the light of  God, who they were made to glorify. Such light would be unbearable. They exist in meaningless darkness,  seeking for nothingness, turning  away from God whose light  burns their sin, their pride, yet they  hold and cling to pride,  to their resentment of God,  for their desire is for God  to erase their created soul as a mistake,  which in their pride is what they would do. God's love is here, ready to  save, and yet they still refuse, forever,  burning in that lake of fire while desperate for  the abyss of nothingness. This is hell.</p> <p>If you want to understand hell,  understand the value of your life,  the value of a single human life. Recognize the divinity of the lowliest  of human lives. Remember that our souls are immortal,  and that we  (created in the image and likeness of the creator of the universe)  will not return to nothingness. A human soul is not destined for nirvana nor moksha --  every soul is destined for truth, be it glorious, be it cold, be it fire.</p> <p>God have mercy on us.</p>"},{"location":"logos/ministry/","title":"Ministry of Christ","text":""},{"location":"logos/ministry/#salvation","title":"Salvation","text":"<p>... soteriology</p> <p>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=34Aq5dF2OUQ</p> <p>covenant of redemption</p> <p>John 17:1-26 (full chapter)</p>"},{"location":"logos/nativity/","title":"Nativity","text":"<p>... a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.

Joachim believed that the end of the Christian era would be in the year 1260, which would see the coming of the Antichrist, followed by a thousand year utopia (the age defined by the Holy Spirit). These views were (perhaps unconsciously) reflected in Nazism, that the 3rd Reich will rule for a thousand years.</p> <p>As Fr. Seraphim Rose notes,</p> <p>revolutionary conclusions were drawn later by men of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, by the Franciscan Spirituals, who recognized in Joachim the new John the Baptist, heralding St. Francis as the novus dux of the last dispensation, even as the \"new Christ\".</p> <p>Any such view of a \"new Christ\" was anathema to orthodox Christianity, yet this corruption in western Christianity was one of many that led inevitably to the Protestant Reformation, itself another outburst of the destructive revolutionary spirit.

And look how they followed when He called,</p> <p>Matthew 4:18-22</p> <p>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</p> <p>And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.</p> <p>And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</p> <p>And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.</p> <p>Many are called, but few are chosen.  Note carefully those that did not follow the call.  And let us reflect honestly and humbly upon the story of the rich young man. A story more apt today than ever before,</p> <p>Matthew 19:16-24</p> <p>And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</p> <p>And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</p> <p>He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p> <p>The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</p> <p>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</p> <p>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p> <p>The rich young man is perfectly endemic to our modern age, to modern Christians, who are very much like this rich young man.  By any account, this young man is being honest when he says he is fulfilling the mosaic law.  We can imagine he was giving his tithing gladly and generously, and was honest and kind with everyone.  Yet still he knew something was missing. </p> <p>Without understanding, he was violating the first commandment, and had placed his possessions -- his worldly status -- above God. And importantly, what is often missed in modern readings of this story, the rich young man was likely healed in that moment. He came to Christ with pride in his heart, believing he might already be perfect; and he left with a broken heart, sorrowful, humbled before God Himself.</p> <p>Psalms 51:17</p> <p>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, A broken and a contrite heart\u2014 These, O God, You will not despise.</p> <p>Likewise, many modern Christians want the worldly benefits of the Christian lifestyle, and like this young man are fulfilling the worldly commandments, but they have not yet known God. They are not following the greatest commandment: to love God with all your heart, mind, and soul. And as we see in the gospel of Luke, it is not just wealth that we place above God,</p> <p>Luke 9:57-62</p> <p>And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</p> <p>And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</p> <p>And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house. And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</p> <p>If we're honest, how often are we placing our careers, our families, our politics, above the worship of God? Contrast that to the apostles who dropped their fishing nets and followed Jesus.  And lest one believe this was only due to Jesus walking among us -- there in the flesh -- we can see that afterwards the faith in believers only grew,</p> <p>Acts 2:44-47</p> <p>And all that believed were together, and had all things common;  And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.  And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,  Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</p> <p>Imagine such faith, not only answering when His church called, but selling all possessions and devoting their lives to Christ and His church.  These followers of Christ succeeded where the rich young man failed, and where we in our modern world fail.</p> <p>It is difficult to imagine such faith today.</p>"},{"location":"modern-views/christianity/#finding-the-way","title":"Finding the Way","text":"<p>Imagine a man who sold everything and went to a modern church, showing up at the door and telling the church staff, \"I have sold everything I own, and now I am here to follow Christ\".</p> <p>It's easy to imagine that a modern church would greedily take this man's money, but would they open their doors to this man outside of Sunday?

In this historic debate  Pelagius wrote against the predestination views of  Augustine, and these objections later became known as  Pelagianism. The Pelagians reacted to the perceived lack  of free will within  Augustine's writings --  this reaction introduced anti-Biblical views  (that original sin did not taint human nature). And all of this was an attempt to allow for human free will in a Christian context. In the end, the Pelagian view  was deemed heretical   (see Canon V from the Council of 418). However, the debate continued afterwards in a reactionary cycle producing various  semi-Pelagian views.</p> <p>Semi-Pelegianism</p> <p>Broadly speaking, a semi-Pelegian view is any that grants humans some ability for salvation independent of God's grace.

This view was reinforced in the  fourth ecumenical council  determining that the person of Christ  has both a human and divine will,  that Christ is both God and man --  a view that was further reinforced in the  sixth ecumenical council. As time went on, this orthodox view of synergism   has occasionally drifted, often times  with deliberate misrepresentations  into semi-Pelagian views,  resulting in renewed debates  that parallel those from early church history.</p> <p>For example,  the protestant debates around   sola fide  or the Calvinist debates around  Arminianism vs Monergism,   these mimic the centuries old Pelagian debates,  including nuanced in-between views such as  Molinism.</p>"},{"location":"modern-views/free-will/#calvinism","title":"Calvinism","text":"<p>As if to re-tell the early Pelagian controversy,  there arose in the 16th century a reaction to the writings of   John Calvin  who was heavily influenced by   the writings of Augustine   on predestination. This reaction -- which started with  Jacobus Arminius and became known as Arminianism -- was especially concerned with Calvin's views of  reprobation  (or what is otherwise known as    double predestination),  which is a logical conclusion to the denial of human free will, that the non-elect were chosen for damnation (that God \"adjudges others to eternal death\").</p> Calvin's continued influece <p>While it's tempting to think that Calvinism is only a topic for theology classrooms, the idea of moral determinism, of the elect / unelect, is very much alive in modern academia and amongst postmodern \"intellectuals\". </p> <p>The belief in a predestined elect, with an unquestioned moral rightness continues to pervade today's political discource -- including every social justice activist, critical race theorist, and so on -- all are assured of their own moral supiority over the uneducated (unelect).</p> <p>While the nomenclature changes, and this is definitely a perversion of theological Calvinism, the spirit is the same. These are the inevitable consequences of moral determinism, of denying human free will.</p> <p>These strict Calvinist views are known as  monergism. The antithetical reaction to monergism came from the writings of  Jacobus Arminius  whose views led (inevitably) to a schism  within the Dutch Reformed Church, such that the  Remonstrant Brotherhood  split from their parent church. Later, the Remonstrant Arminian view was explicitly condemned   at the   Synod of Dort  which is what led to the articulation of the  five points of Calvinism  known by the mnemonic acronym TULIP and is generally what we mean by Calvinism today.</p> <p>And exactly as the condemnation of Pelagianism resulted in the emergence of semi-Pelagianism, the condemnation of Remonstrant Arminianism led inevitably to a rationalistic Arminianism. In the century after Dort there was a migration away from strict monergism but not stopping at rational Arminianism, instead it inevitably produced  deism,  itself a stepping stone into the postmodern malaise and meaning crisis.

In rationalistic terms, monergism insists that God is 100% responsible for man's salvation, but reprobation is to say God is 100% responsible for man's condemnation. Thus man's will is not sufficient to participate in his own salvation, because all was predetermined.</p> <p>The orthodox view of synergism is to say God is 100% responsible for man's salvation while conversely man is 100% responsible for his own condemnation. And thus man willfully participates in his own salvation.</p> <p>While we can easily dispense with the semi-Pelagian  views of Arminianism,  if we are truly concerned with truth,  then we are left with an ongoing  debate between   strict monergism  and  orthodox synergism.

The five points of Calvinism contain within their strict dogma  a seed of semi-Pelagianism, be it Arminianism or Molinism or  whatever the -ism.</p> <p>This is necessarily true because the five points of Calvinism (TULIP) are true from a transcendent level of analysis, and not the particular level of human behavior and consciousness.

God is a character in the  Bible, as is man,  who was created in the image  and likeness of God. This is not an impersonal God of deism. God is not only personal, but our very  notion of personhood is from God,  that is, we possess personhood because  we were made in the image and likeness of God. Our free will exists in that we  participate in His will. And His will is done.  He is the transcendent source of all creation. Even God hardening (strengthening)  Pharoah's heart,   this is what allowed Pharoah  to follow his own free will into   certain destruction.</p> <p>These two revealed truths, of God's sovereignty and man's free will, create a potential dilemma, as effectively both sides of the free will debate are strongly affirmed in the Bible. And thus any interpretation of scripture which denies one side can be declared false. And the question of reconciling these seemingly contrary views is left as a divine mystery, one that parallels the life and character of Jesus Christ.</p> <p>This in effect is affirmed in the Chalcedonian Definition  (from the  fourth ecumenical council) that Christ has two wills and that Christ is both God and man. This necessarily implies that man's free  will not only exists but that it  can be redeemed in Christ. Note also how the human will of Christ  not only was tempted by Satan, but also  participates in the will of the father,  with perfect obedience so as to glorify God (the father). Christ's human will participated harmoniously with His divine will, and did so in a way that makes it possible for us to participate harmoniously with His divine sovereign will. By coming to Christ we find in Christ  an answer to the free will  question;  and we find affirmation that any interpretation  that denies or compromises free will or that denies or compromises God's ultimate sovereignty, any such compromised views are as heretical and false as denying that Christ is both God and man.</p> <p>Only by affirming that Christ is both God and man, such that man is both free and completely subject to God's sovereignty, can we make sense of the Bible. This is what is traditionally known as  synergism  from the Greek synergoi, as Saint Paul writes,</p> <p>1 Corinthians 3:9</p> <p>\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b3\u03ac\u03c1 \u1f10\u03c3\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03af\u00b7 \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b3\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5.</p> <p>Theou gar esmen synergoi; Theou ge\u00f4rgion, Theou oecodom\u00ea este.</p> <p>For we are fellow workers with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.</p> <p>Orthodox synergism is notably different from modern Roman Catholic synergism as well as rational Arminian synergism, in that the orthodox view affirms God's absolute sovereignty through Christ's divine will, while simultaneously affirming man's free will through Christ's human will. This does not compromise on irresistible grace nor total depravity, nor any of the five points of Calvinism (though it does disagree with reprobation). In fact, it becomes clear that Calvinism speaks of Christ's divine will while making no claims about Christ's human will and the necessary implications to man's free will. Or rather, this is why Calvinists find reprobation (double predestination) so controversial.</p> <p>Ultimately, the creator of the universe became flesh, became man -- the divine Logos incarnate. And as such lived with sinless perfection, participating in the divine will through His human will.</p> <p>While orthodox synergism has often been maligned and misrepresented  (conflated with Roman Catholic synergism or Arminian semi-Pelagian heresies),  the core doctrine of orthodox synergy remains crucial  and necessary to the truth of the Biblical narrative.</p> <p>In fact, there were attempts at reconciliation between the early reformed church  and the Eastern Orthodox church. Unfortunately this did not lead to unification,  although it did bear good fruits in what is known as  The Confession of Dositheus  which better articulated the Eastern Orthodox positions  with respect to reformed theology more generally.

Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?  And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.  Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.

There's a better debate to be had on reprobation, but it's unlikely to be resolved with sola fide.</p> <p>Similarly, if you're a Lutheran then you ought to avoid the cheap grace that Dietrich Bonhoeffer warned against.

We ought to instead be obedient and pray for grace, pray for faith sufficient to our salvation, which can be seen through the fruit of our works. Remember, God's grace is always sufficient.</p> <p>Imagine if the thief on the cross survived and went back to worldly life -- would he have shown no change in behavior? Would there have been no good fruits from good works? The Lord provides sufficient works so as to perfect our faith. For the thief on the cross, this was martyrdom.

(Rm 4:18-25)</p> <p>John Chrysostom</p> <p>Faith without works is dead, and works without faith are dead also. For if we have sound doctrine but fail in living, the doctrine is of no use to us. Likewise if we take pains with life but are careless about doctrine, that will not be any good to us either. It is therefore necessary to shore up the spiritual edifice in both directions.</p> <p>And the reference to Abraham is particularly instructive as we can gain a sound exegesis about the relationship between faith and works through commentary about Abraham, e.g.,</p> <p>1 Maccabees 2:52</p> <p>Was not Abraham found faithful when tested, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness?</p> <p>Hebrews 11:17-19</p> <p>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,  Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:  Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</p> <p>Works are not irrelevant or unnecessary but they are the means to perfect one's faith. Or as St. Paul made clear: faith working through love.</p> <p>Galatians 5:4-6</p> <p>Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.  For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.  For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</p> <p>Works to St. Paul are inseparable from faith, as it is faith that works from love (by the grace of God). Twisting St. Paul's words to fit sola fide removes the spiritual depth of his teaching.</p> <p>Romans 8:30</p> <p>Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</p> <p>This passage remained relatively uncontroversial for the first thousand years of Christianity, however, as we near the great schism between east and west, we can find evidence of some debate through the writings of St. Symeon the New Theologian,</p> <p>St. Symeon the New Theologian</p> <p>I have heard many people say: \u201cBecause the Apostle says; \u2018Those whom God foreknew, the same He also predestined; and those whom He predestined, He also called; and those whom He called, the same also glorified\u2018 [Romans 8:29-30] what good is it to me if I throw myself into many labors, if I give proof of repentance and conversion, when I am neither foreknown nor predestined by God to be saved and conformed to the glory of God His Son?\u201d</p> <p>We are naturally obliged to state our opinion clearly to such people, and to reply: O, you! Why do you reason to your own perdition rather than your salvation? And why do you pick out for yourselves the obscure passages of inspired Scripture and then tear them out of context and twist them in order to accomplish your own destruction? Do you not hear the Savior crying out every day: \u201cAs I live \u2026 I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live\u201d [Ezekiel 33:11]? Do you not hear Him Who says: \u201cRepent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand\u201d [Matthew 3:2]; and again: \u201cJust so, I tell you, there is joy in heaven over one sinner who repents\u201d [Luke 15:7, adapted]? Did He ever say to some: \u201cDo not repent for I will not accept you,\u201d while to others who were predestined: \u201cBut you, repent! because I knew you beforehand\u201d? Of course not! Instead, throughout the world and in every church He shouts: \u201cCome to Me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\u201d [Matthew 11:28]. Come, He says, all you who are burdened with many sins, to the One Who takes away the sin of the world; come all who thirst to the fountain which flows and never dies.</p> <p>We can see at least an inversion of sola fide here, or rather a belief in reprobation. St. Symeon continues,</p> <p>St. Symeon the New Theologian</p> <p>Does He distinguish and separate anyone out, calling one to Himself as foreknown while sending the other away as not predestined? Never! Therefore, \u201cyou should not make excuses for your sins\u201d [Psalm 140:4, LXX], nor should you want to make the Apostle\u2019s words an occasion for your own destruction, but should run, all of you, to the Master Who calls you. For even if someone is a publican, or a fornicator, an adulterer, a murderer, or whatever else, the Master does not turn him away, but takes away the burden of his sins immediately and makes him free. And how does He take away the other\u2019s burden? Just as He once took away that of the paralytic when He said to the latter: \u201cMy son, your sins are forgiven\u201d [Matthew 9:2], and the man was immediately relieved of his burden and, in addition, received the cure of his body.</p> <p>So then, let everyone who wants approach Him, and let the one say: \u201cSon of David, have mercy on me\u201c; and, if he hears, \u201cWhat do you want Me to do for you?\u201d let him say quickly, \u201cLord, let me receive my sight,\u201d and right away he will hear, \u201cSo I desire. Receive your sight\u201d [Luke 18:38-42]. Let another say, \u201cLord, my daughter\u201c\u2013i.e. my soul\u2013\u201cis severely possessed by a demon\u201d [Matthew 15:22], and he will hear: \u201cI will come to heal her\u201d [Matthew 8:7]. If someone is hesitant and does not wish to approach the Master, even if He comes to him and says, \u201cFollow Me\u201d [Matthew 9:9], then let him follow Him as the publican once did, abandoning his counting tables and his avarice, and, I am sure, He shall make of him, too, an evangelist rather than a tax collector. If someone else is a paralytic, lying for years in sloth, carelessness, and love of pleasure, and if he should see another, be it the Master Himself or one of His disciples, come to him and ask, \u201cDo you want to be healed?\u201d [John 5:2-7], let him receive the word joyfully and reply immediately: \u201cYes, Lord, but I have no man to put me into the pool of repentance.\u201d And then if he should hear, \u201cRise, take up your bed, and follow me,\u201d let him get up right away and run after the footsteps of the One Who has called him from on high.</p> <p>St. Symeon's commentary is apt today even in reformed theology about justification and orthodox synergy, e.g.,</p> <p>St. Symeon the New Theologian</p> <p>Now, if someone does not wish, whether like the sinful woman to embrace the feet of Christ [Luke 7:38], or like the prodigal son to run back to Him with burning repentance [Luke 15:11ff], or like the woman with a hemorrhage and bowed with infirmity [Luke 8:43 and 13:11] even to approach Him, why does he then make excuses for his sins by saying, \u201cThose whom He foreknew, them also\u201c\u2013and them alone!\u2013\u201cHe called\u201c?</p> <p>One may perhaps reasonably reply to the person so disposed that \u201cGod, Who is before eternity and Who knows all things before creating them, also knew you beforehand, knew that you would not obey Him when He called, that you would not believe in His promises and in His words, yet still, even while knowing this, He \u201cbowed the heavens and came down\u201d [Psalm 18:19] and became man, and for your sake has come to the place where you lie prone. Indeed, visiting you many times every day, sometimes in His own Person and sometimes as well through His servants, He exhorts you to get up from the calamity in which you lie and to follow Him Who ascends to the Kingdom of Heaven and enter it together with Him. But you, you still refuse to do it.</p> <p>Then tell me, who is responsible for your perdition and disobedience? You, who refuse to obey and who will not follow your Master, or God Himself Who made you, Who knew beforehand that you would not obey Him, but would instead abide in your hardened and impenitent heart? I think that you will certainly say, \u201cHe is not responsible, but I am myself,\u201d because God\u2019s forbearance is not the cause of our hardness, Rather, it is our own lack of compliance.</p> <p>For God knows all things beforehand, both past and present at once, and everything which is going to happen in the future up to the end of the world. He sees them as already present, because in and through Him all things hold together [Colossians 1:17]. Indeed, just as today the emperor takes in with a glance those who race and who wrestle in the area, but does not thereby make himself responsible for the victory of the winners or the failure of the losers\u2013the zeal, or in other cases the slackness, of the contestants being cause of their victory or defeat\u2013understand with me that it is just so with God Himself. When He endowed us with free will, giving commandments to teach us instead how we must oppose our adversaries, He left it to the free choice of each either to oppose and vanquish the enemy, or to relax and be miserably defeated by him. Nor does He leave us entirely to ourselves\u2013for He knows the weakness of human nature\u2013but rather is present Himself with us and, indeed, allies Himself with those who choose to struggle, and mysteriously imbues us with strength, and Himself, not we, accomplishes the victory over the adversary. This the earthly emperor is unable to do, since he is himself also a man, and is rather in need himself of assistance, just as we require it, too.</p> <p>St. Symeon the New Theologian</p> <p>So tell me, where did you learn that you did not belong to those who are foreknown and predestined to become conformed to the image of God\u2019s glory? Tell me, who told you this? Was it, maybe, God Who announced this to you, Himself, or by one of His prophets, or through an angel? \u201cNo,\u201d you say, \u201cbut I do suppose that I am not predestined to salvation, and that all my effort would be in vain.\u201d And why do you not believe instead with all your soul that God has sent His only-begotten Son on the earth for your sake alone, and for your salvation, that He knew you beforehand and predestined you to become His brother and co-heir? Why are you not eager to love Him with all your heart and to honor His saving commandments? Why do you not rather believe that, having been slaughtered for your sake, He will never abandon you, nor allow you to perish? Do you not hear Him saying: \u201cCan a woman forget her suckling child . . . yet I will not forget you\u201d [Isaiah 49:15]? So, if by anticipation you judge yourself unworthy, and willfully separate yourself from the flock of Christ\u2019s sheep, you should understand that it is none other than you who are the cause of your own damnation.</p> <p>Therefore, casting out of our souls all faithlessness, sloth, and hesitation, let us draw near with all our heart, with unhesitating faith and burning desire, like slaves who have been newly purchased with precious blood. Indeed, with reverence for the price paid on our behalf, and with love for our Master Who paid it, and as having accepted His love for us, let us recognize that, if He had not wished to save by means of Himself us who have been purchased, He would not have come down to earth, nor would He have been slain for our sake. But, as it is written, He has done this because He wills that all should be saved. Listen to Him say it Himself: \u201cI did not come to judge the world, but to save the world\u201d [John 12:17].</p>"},{"location":"modern-views/millennialism/","title":"Millennialism","text":"<p>Millennialism is a modern belief in a future utopia, usually a thousand year period (a literal millennium).

Zero as a number and a placeholder did not exist.  And perhaps coincidentally, when zero was finally adopted in the west, that was about the same time that chiliasm emerged (during the early scholastic period).</p> <p>Prior to that, and through all of church history, chilia et\u0113 was understood symbolically as an age or an era.

To the early Christians, this era known as ta chilia et\u0113 was the messianic age, the penultimate age before final judgment, the time between the first and second coming of Christ.</p> <p>Contrast this with modern millennialist views which do not reference the messianic age at all, because they need a separate name to refer to our current age. In practice they'll refer to our current age as the \"church age\", which is separate from the future millennium -- effectively inventing a new age to match their eisegesis.</p> <p>The earliest form of modern millennialism is probably the utopian views of   the Joachimites   which arose in the thirteenth century, proposing  a new \"age of the Holy Spirit\" heralded by   Francis of Assisi  such that in the year 1260 the Christian age would end and a utopian era would arrive. While condemned by the church this view influenced and continues to influence modern culture,   e.g., we see this clearly in  the modern new age movement, such as the so-called  Age of Aquarius.

By AD 1054 the east and west officially excommunicated each other (first Rome excommunicated the patriarch of Constantinople, then all four eastern patriarchs excommunicated Rome). </p> <p>Later, in the 16th century the  protestant reformation started a process of continuous schisms within the decaying Holy Roman Empire. Despite specific theological objections, the protestant reformation was mostly along ethnic lines, succeeding in northern Europe (England, Germany, Netherlands, etc) with a notable exception of Ireland which stayed Catholic. This left the Roman Catholic Church dominant in southern Europe, notably within the boundaries of the romance languages (Italy, France, Spain, Portugal).</p> <p>Reformation Schisms</p> <p></p> <p>Along these schismatic lines, Roman Catholicism spread into Central and South America (colonies from Spain and Portugal), whereas Protestantism spread into North America (immigrants from northern Europe). In fact many of the early settlers into the north-American colonies were escaping religious persecution (such as the various anabaptist sects).</p> <p>This splintering of protestantism never ceased and continues now into our modern age.  There are now tens of thousands of different \"Christian\" sects. In fact, a modern protestant is likely to experience a schism even at their own local church, which are usually anchored only by a popular pastor. It's important to understand that this splintering is a continuation of the great schism of AD 1054 and feeds into the continuous destructive revolutions of our modern worldview.</p> <p>Timeline of Major Schisms</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"modern-views/schisms/#christs-church","title":"Christ's Church","text":"<p>In the midst of these continuous schisms, when someone says they are a Christian, what does that even mean?</p> <p>As atheists are want to point out, it is as if the so-called \"Christians\" are arbitrarily picking and choosing passages from scriptures that adhere to their   modern secular worldview.

In a protestant worldview, my own personal interpretation of scripture is as valid as any. This is encouraged within a secular worldview, and this is to turn our back on Christ Himself.</p> <p>And even if you were to find a pious protestant church, how long till that church falls into blatant heresy? How many churches today have founders that would war against their modern members?

The church was unified under Christ, guided by the Holy Spirit, not by a worldly empire, and certainly not by an empire that wouldn't arise till nearly a thousand years after Christ.</p> <p>Despite the name, the Holy Roman Empire was not the continuation of the old Roman Empire, nor even the Western Roman Empire which had fallen in AD 476. The Eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, survived till AD 1453 (making it the longest living empire in the known history of the world). The historic grounds for Roman Catholicism as the one holy catholic and apostolic church is tenuous at best.</p> <p>Voltaire</p> <p>This agglomeration which was called and which still calls itself the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire.</p> <p>This was not always the case, prior to the great schism there was one holy catholic and apostolic church in both the East and the West. There is a thousand years of historical evidence, ecumenical councils, church fathers, and even pagan Roman history attesting to the persecution of these unified Christians.</p> <p>In fact, immediately after the great schism, most all Christians had no idea there even was a schism. Even afterwards, entire generations had no idea. And those that did know assumed it would be resolved as prior schisms always were.  When you're focused on Christ, the specifics of a temporary schism motivated by worldly empires is not actually all that important. </p> <p>Because of this, we must concede that despite questionable historicity, modern Catholicism has a strong claim to be the original church. In fact, necessarily both east and west were Christ's church in the first thousand years. Other than getting muddier over time, did east or west at some point cease being His church?</p> <p>Like in the parable of the prodigal son, there were two sons, the younger left to waste his inheritance. He was still his father's son even while he was lost (in schism from the Father). And importantly, the older son who did not leave, he was rebuked for questioning his father after the prodigal son returned. Ultimately, both sons were in error.</p> <p>Likewise, one or both sides of the great schism is necessarily in error. This is true of any schism. The only question; which side of the schism is the prodigal son, and which is the older brother?</p> <p>While earlier schisms often resulted in a failed sect, like the many gnostic or Arian sects, Eastern and Western Christianity have both survived over a thousand years while in schism. They are both the remnants of long-lived empires, and both of those worldly empires have fallen. The gates of hell have not prevailed. It is perhaps wise to look at east and west as if they are both in error, and follow Christ obediently towards salvation.</p> <p>Importantly, we as Christians cannot judge His church; Truth is not decided by our judgement, but on His revelation and His judgment. If \"you\" decide to be Catholic or Orthodox or even protestant, you're choosing nihilism and not Christ. </p> <p>\"You\" do not determine truth. </p> <p>\"You\" can only rationalize beliefs. </p> <p>And your beliefs are irrelevant to Truth, who is the person Christ Jesus.</p> <p>We ought to discern carefully here, and we should proceed cautiously. Our goal is to follow Christ and not antichrist.</p> <p>If we can understand that both eastern and westerm Christendom were the one holy catholic and apostolic church, then we must ask: Are there heretical innovations that must be resolved in order to begin discussing unification between east and west?</p> <p>The Catholic answer, is maybe, and we have an instructive case of Eastern Catholics.</p> <p>The Orthodox answer, is yes, absolutely there are many heretical innovations from Rome that must be resolved in order to unify, such as:</p> <ul> <li>filioque -- why was it added? What specific heresy is this guarding against? And why did the east not fall into that heresy without the filioque? Why was it added the way it was added?</li> <li>papal supremacy and infallibility -- it did not exist for most of church history. Was everyone in the early church wrong? What about the innovations of Vatican I, and Vatican II?</li> </ul> <p>From a Roman Catholic perspective, what would need to change about the Orthodox churches for them to unify? We can look at Eastern Catholics to get an idea. Not much changes, but they must grant authority to the pope. Unification according to Roman Catholicism is thus not about Christ, but about the authority of the pope.</p> <p>Catholics claim that papal supremacy is from Peter. Would the apostle Peter agree with the Roman Catholic claim of supremacy and the infallibility of the pope's teaching as head of the church?  Did not Paul once rebuke Peter on his official teaching?  Did not Christ himself rebuke Peter many times?</p> <p>Galatians 2:14</p> <p>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</p> <p>And, most fascinating and perhaps with great prescience, the greatest rebuke to Peter came immediately after Christ promised that Peter is the rock upon which Christ will build His church.</p> <p>Matthew 16:18-24</p> <p>And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.  And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ.</p> <p>From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day. Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, \"Far be it from You, Lord; this shall not happen to You!\"</p> <p>But He turned and said to Peter, \"Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.\" Then Jesus said to His disciples, \u201cIf anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\"</p> <p>No man except the God-man is infallible. But even if we grant the claim of papal infallibility (when the Roman Pontiff speaks ex cathedra), why would that come in AD 1870? Why is the successor to Peter only infallible in modern times and only in Rome?</p> <p>Peter also founded the church in Antioch, which is an Orthodox Church.  Is Peter's successor in Antioch also infallible? If infallibility was due to the importance of Rome then wouldn't infallibility have been granted to Constantinople? Old Rome had fallen during that first thousand years of the one holy catholic and apostolic church. Importantly, these are the concerns of men -- the very reason Christ rebuked Peter.</p> <p>Very obviously there was no infallible \"vicar of Christ\" in the one holy catholic and apostolic church (otherwise there would have been no need for ecumenical councils), and it is very clear that these are innovations and deviations from tradition. And yet, like the prodigal son, this is still Christ's church, even if that church is wasting its inheritance while in schism.</p>"},{"location":"modern-views/schisms/#orthodoxy","title":"Orthodoxy","text":"<p>When Orthodox churches fall out of communion with each other, it is not hidden nor quietly resolved by a \"vicar of Christ\". Unification requires the two sides settle their difference as guided by the Holy Spirit. Traditionally, this was done at ecumenical councils, but there has not been such a council in over a thousand years.</p> <p>The councils were started by Constantine himself, in the Eastern Roman Empire. These councils resulted in a deeper articulation of Christian faith. The schisms were ultimately a good and necessary feature of the church, the means to make public all differences that must be resolved before communion.</p> <p>However, after the great schism, while the west innovated, the east stagnated (at least by our modern secular worldview). For better or worse, the Eastern Orthodox Church has not changed anything since those days of one holy catholic and apostolic church.</p> <p>The goal of Orthodoxy is not vain unity, nor any kind of unity.  The goal of Orthodoxy is Christ.  Ultimately, Christ is the spirit of Truth, and He does not hide in darkness nor deceit.

Can that even be a heresy?</p> <p>Why was there not a protestant reformation in the east? Protestantism and its continuous disintegration into different sects certainly seems to be the fruits of the scholastic innovations in Roman Catholicism, fruits that were not seen in Eastern Orthodoxy.</p> <p>Lastly, if the goal is to commune with Christ, to come closer to Christ through His church, then why innovate? Would not the apostolic tradition be paramount above all else? Why change? </p> <p>And if there was necessary change, is that not a tacit admission that everyone who came before, every saint (even western saints) within the one holy catholic and apostolic church was wrong or naive?

How are they wrong today yet were right in the first thousand years of church history?</p> <p>All things considered, it looks an awful lot like Rome is in heresy, in schism from Christ's Church, and Eastern Orthodoxy is waiting patiently, \"stuck\" in the past as it were, waiting and waiting and waiting for the prodigal son of Rome and its protestant offspring to return to the Father. </p> <p>At worst, Orthodox Churches are like the older son to the prodigal son, and as such many will receive the Father's rebuke on that day the prodigal son returns.</p> <p>As Christians we ought to follow Christ, who taught us the story of the prodigal son, and we ought to identify ourselves and our church with the prodigal son and also with the older brother.
