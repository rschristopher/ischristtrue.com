As such,  many young and curious seekers of truth  approach the  fundamental questions  of life and fully expect  to find answers amongst the  philosophers  and so-called  \"intellectuals\"  of our modern age. For surely they must have answers --  these are afterall the   most fundamental questions  one could ever ask.</p> <p>Unfortunately, what we  find amongst the learned  philosophers and professional  intellectuals  is a nihilistic  program of   dead ideas,  a history of the failures   to answer  any  of the fundamental questions --  and we're left with  rationalizations and word games,  as if to  desensitize honest seekers,  to soothe them into  accepting the inevitable nihilism  that follows from not answering  the fundamental questions of life.</p> <p>Find one of these so-called  experts and ask them yourself -- Can we know anything? What does it mean to know?</p> <p>They may tell you about  epistemology,  about \"justified true belief\",  about the   Gettier problem,  and you'll find yourself  reading the likes of  Hume,  Kant,  Nietzsche,   Hegel,   Wittgenstein,  and many others. Or perhaps the absurdists like  Camus.  Or  if you have the temprament for it,  postmodernists like  Foucault. And then after a lot of study,  all you'll know is that  the mere concept of  objective truth doesn't  actually exist, or at least  is not knowable -- except  we can't even know that,  because to claim such a thing is  itself an objective truth claim.</p> <p>We now know less than we did  before we started. We could pretend everything is  rational and call ourselves  \"realists\" or  \"pragmatists\". And then like a pendulum   we could swing the other way and  embrace any of the esoteric  spiritual systems that are competing  for our attention;  transcendental  something-or-other. Maybe   Buddhists  have knowable objective truth. Or maybe one of the various  gurus  or   antigurus. Maybe we revert back to  secular liberalism, and find  ourselves yearning for the  comforts of ancient religious  beliefs that we just can't  bring ourselves to literally believe.</p> <p>For what is belief other than how  we act in the face of the  pain and suffering of life? What is it that we actually believe? And why do none of these  modern belief systems  offer any foundational answers  and always seem to bring us  further and further away  from those fundamental questions  we originally wanted to answer?</p> <p>The very nature of these questions presupposes that truth is not just facts about the way things are, but also meaning and morality about the way things should be. This is, afterall, the human condition. We ought to know something,  anything, about  our own existence.</p> <p>As the old Maori prayer goes,</p> <p>the light, the light ~ the seeking, the searching ~ in chaos, in chaos</p>"},{"location":"truth/#knowing-truth","title":"Knowing Truth","text":"<p>This should be a simple question,  is there objective knowable truth? Does truth exist?</p> <p>In the modern view,  there is no objective knowable truth. There are word games. There is a cascade of unconsciously   held beliefs behind every word,  even the word \"truth\". There is suffering. There is power and oppression. There is the deconstruction of  everything, even deconstructionism itself. Once again, we move further and further  away from the fundamental questions.</p> <p>If you are at all serious about pursuing  and knowing truth,  you may want to consider an alternative  to the fashionable trends of modern  philosophy which aims  away from fundamental questions,  as if on purpose. You may want to consider that the  entire enlightenment project  has yielded exactly this assault  on the fundamental questions,  and that it is specifically   anti-Christian in  its aim: from the secular humanists  with their watered down  Christian traditions,  to the pragmatists and devout  atheists, all the way to the esoteric  spiritual revivalism that springs  forth inevitably from the  spiritually dead atheists  and the spiritually weak humanists. All of these seemingly disparate worldviews  share a singular and notable feature:  to weaken and reject Christianity,  which just so happens to be the origin   of \"knowable objective truth\". For those who still hold a belief in  knowable objective truth and yet  reject Christianity, you are operating  on the fumes of a  dead Christian worldview,  and you'll find only absurdity at the  other end of your venture.</p> <p>But aha, you may be asking,  what about the ancient Romans  and their concept of a divine truth,  veritas? Or the stoics? Or the ancient Greek philosophers? Plato and Aristotle certainly had a lot to say on this matter. Christianity might have copied   the concept of an objective  knowable truth, but they did  not invent it, right? Except that veritas was a  pagan Goddess, daughter of Saturn,  in some tellings she was a creation  of Prometheus --  not exactly what we mean when  talking about truth. The stoics referred to the  anima mundi and a divine logos that brought the universe into being. And Plato referred to a  demiurge and platonic forms  which hardly bear a resemblance to  what we mean when talking  about objective knowable truth. Aristotle recognized that a first principle of logos is necessarily unexplainable (for if a first principle had a causal explanation than that cause would be the first principle). Ultimately, these concepts, especially of logos as first principle synthesized with equivalent Hebrew thought, and formed the basis of Christianity and what we mean today by   objective knowable truth.</p> <p>To be clear, if you claim to be a  rationalist,  an  empiricist,  someone who follows  science  and does not believe in  anything you can't  see with your own eyes,  then you will find yourself  unmoored from any first principles  necessary for even a pretense  of objective truth, and you've  probably numbed yourself to those  fundamental questions, and perhaps   stopped asking. You can ignore the fundamental questions,  but non-belief in an otherwise \"unseen\" reality   doesn't negate the existence of that reality. You don't live in a mechanistic universe,  because fundamental questions are  not mechanistic and yet still exist  and are still fundamental. You don't live in an absurdist universe --  accepting absurdism is to  abandon reason and will. And you certainly don't live in a   postmodernist  universe.</p> <p>The postmodern \"deconstructions\" of  modern views  will yield absurdity,  but they are still apt critiques  of the prideful rationalism we see in  secular culture. There does indeed appear to be a patriarchal hierarchy  which is the foundation for any and all  objective truth claims. It indeed can't be otherwise. The patriarchy, perhaps, is real! And yet it doesn't seem to be man-made, in fact it's the fabric of reality. It's everywhere the empiricists look. On some level the postmodernists  know this, and still reject it  (and hence reject truth itself).</p> <p>They'll say, \"my truth\", \"your truth\",  because truth to them is relative,  a language game of power. Yet we can't say this without making yet  another objective truth claim. Hypocrisy would bother them if they  believed in objective truth. But really, they are assaulting the very  idea of knowable objective truth,  reducing it to self worship.</p> <p>For truth to have any meaning,  then truth must transcend all subjective  perspectives. Something is true if it is objectively true,  and knowledge of this objectivity  is what brings people to \"the Truth\".</p> <p>Modern views  frame  truth as an attribute,  that something is either true or it is not. But in practice,  truth is experienced in very personal ways,  and not at all confined to sense perceptions. We once understood this in our culture,  that truth is revealed to you personally.</p> <p>Ancient views  understood truth as a spirit,  which means Truth was  something akin to a person. If there is a spirit of truth,  then we should not ask,  \"what is true?\"  we ought to ask  \"who is truth?\" In fact, as we shall see,  this is the only way  we can even hope to arrive  at knowable objective truth.</p>"},{"location":"truth/#spirit-of-truth","title":"Spirit of Truth","text":"<p>The spirit of truth,  like any spirit,  can be thought of as a  pattern of reality. A pattern of reality that is as  objective as it is real  (and not  a veil of delusions  or perceptions). In other words, that which  is objectively real is  the spirit we are referring. And rather than a what,  truth is better understood as a who.</p> What is a Spirit? <p>A spirit is any pattern of reality with conscious agency.</p> <p>In a secular worldview we might refer  to the \"emergent\" pattern and behavior  of a complex system or  ideology.

It might make demands of us;  we might participate in or  be mere components of the  these spirits. Understood properly, we can see spirits  everywhere, in all manner of systems   that we interact with and participate in. Anyone can \"see\" spirits, if not directly  through symbolism or iconography,  but through patterns of reality  over time.</p> <p>If you haven't thought of a spirit  in this way, and instead  think of spirits as  translucent ghosts that don't   interact with our world but hover  about --  this is most certainly not a spirit,  this is a childish caricature  and it demonstrates the unquestioned  nihilism that possesses our modern sensibilities.

E.g., even the leaf turning to face the sun; the functionality is obvious, the leaf is absorbing as much sunlight as possible. But what is the meaning and morality of a leaf turning to face the sun? The meaning is to use the sun's energy to convert water into energy for the tree. The morality is that the tree is good when it does this, it flourishes with sun, and dies otherwise. And most fascinating, if you perceive one aspect of a truth claim, such as a moral intuition, you can then grasp the other attributes, including meaning. Apply this to life itself, and examine the moral intuitions of what it means to live in a way that is good, and you'll simultaneously arrive at the meaning of life.</p> <p>In our modern reductionist worldview, we often blind ourselves to revealed truths, even while our attention is captivated by, say, the beauty of a sunset, we'll fail to see the meaning. If you cannot understand the meaning  of the most basic things,  such as a leaf on a tree,  then how could you possibly   understand the  meaning of life -- let alone the meaning of  suffering and death?</p> <p>Seeking truth is then not an  idle hobby of armchair philosophers. Seeking truth is to orient your entire  life into a relationship  with the Spirit of Truth,  with God,  revealing meaning  sufficient to endure the suffering  of this world.</p> <p>Importantly, by denying objective morality and beauty -- denying that morality and beauty are objectively knowable -- you will be left with the inversion of beauty and morality, which is fashion and relativism. And you will find yourself in a meaning crises, as relativism does not provide meaning sufficient for the challenges of life.

That is, the Spirit of Truth is  the creator of the universe,  who was incarnate as man,  who was crucified for us,  and on the third day He  rose again. To be clear, there is no justifiable   epistemology outside of Christianity  and these seemingly outrageous claims. There have been   countless attempts,  but all lead to nihilism,  to a rejection of knowable truth. Rejecting the uniquely Christian notion  of knowable truth yields only  a desperate yearning for  nothingness  (to return to nothingness).</p> <p>And even more outrageous,  Christ is the mediator between  God and man, between God the Father   and man -- and thus between  God's will and man.

Beauty draws you to Him, revealing His design, beckoning you to return to a state of grace. To believe in objective  knowable truth is to   necessarily also believe that your soul is eternal.

As such, it can best be thought of as a role, like a job title.  However when talking of angels we typically are not referring to a job title.  We are referring to spiritual beings.  Angels are spiritual beings, and demons are evil spirits.  If we believe in God then we typically view demons as fallen angels, fallen from God's grace.</p> <p>The Bible, and the gospels in particular, are filled with references to angels and demons.  Yet there's also references to other spiritual beings such as thrones, dominions, and principalities.  And there's references to archangels, hinting not only to job titles but instead to a rank, a hierarchy. Additionally, there's references to heavenly hosts, to \"sons of God\", to cherubim and seraphim, and of course nephelim -- the famed giants precipitating the great flood.</p> <p>And most striking, there's even references to other gods.

Paganism is commonly associated with the Greek and Roman pantheon of gods, but we can analyze the broader sense of paganism within world mythologies. In doing so we find that the myriad of mythological gods have a lot in common.</p> <p>In pagan mythologies we find identical themes: regional gods have dominion over nature, and man is subordinate to these gods, worshipping and giving sacrifice. The pagan gods are typically indifferent or antagonistic to humans; such that humans are nothing but the playthings of these gods.</p> <p>The innovation in Judiaism is the realization (revelation) that the God most high is not only the creator of all, but also the source of morality, a universal morality, that good and evil are objectively knowable, and as such only the God most high is to be worshipped. Contrast this with the Roman pantheon, where the gods of conquered people were collected and worshipped.</p> <p>Within pagan mythologies you'll even find stories of a great flood, and even some heavenly rebellions -- although interestingly, the pagan gods all succeded in their rebellions: Zeus overthrew his father Cronus, who had in turn castrated his father Heaven (Uranus); Kumarbi overthrew Anu (biting off his genitals); Set killed his brother Osiris, the perfect pharoah; and then Horus, the son of Osiris, overthrows Set.

Or at least that's how it's referred to in our modern secular view, which can feel a bit dry and lifeless unless we really think about it what is actually happening. Closer approximations in modern vernacular might be something \"that blew my mind\" or a \"raising of consciousness\" amongst the new age folks who like to read Carl Jung. But really nothing in our modern speech comes close to the true meaning of metanoia.</p> <p>The etymology points to the Greek, meta- meaning change, and -noia from nous which is best understood as the faculty of mind that determines what is true or real. Thus it is a change of mind in the deepest possible sense, not just what you think is true, but a change to the very faculty of how you know what is true.</p> <p>Perhaps the closest we have today is the matrix or any state of waking up from a false worldview into something irrefutably true, such that the old worldview dissolves like a bad dream.</p> <p>If you have had a dream where you wake up and yet you're still dreaming, and only later, when you wake up for real do you finally come to your senses -- such an experience is metanoia. It is radical transformation in one's person. To get the beam out of your own eye, that is metanoia.</p> <p>Ancient Christians (and modern orthodox Christians) use this word to describe conversion. And this is because conversion to Christianity involves a radical change in one's heart, soul, and mind. One's nous opens into a relationship with the creator of the universe , the sprit of truth, which is Christ, and one develops an orthodox Christian phronema, the first step to theosis, of becoming like Christ.</p> <p>axiom</p> <p>first principles</p> <p>root cause</p> <p>necessarily taken on faith, for if there was a cause of a first principle, that cause would be the first principle </p> <p>Jonathan Swift</p> <p>Reasoning will never make a Man correct an ill Opinion, which by Reasoning he never acquired</p> <p>Or as it's usually paraphrased, </p> <p>You Cannot Reason People Out of Something They Were Not Reasoned Into</p> <p>We can see here a clear example of the enlightenment mistake, the unquestioned belief in reason itself as a first principle. To put it succinctly, ones belief in reason cannot be reasoned into (thus people will abandon reason, without good reason).</p> <p>Schopenhauer provides a more refined example of this mistake, </p> <p>Schopenhauer</p> <p>Founders of religion and philosophers come into the world to shake them out of their lethargy and to point out the lofty meaning of existence; philosophers for the few, the exempt; founders of religion for the many, for humanity on a large scale. For \u2018it is impossible for the broad masses to be philosophically educated\u2019, as even your Plato said, and you should not forget. Religion is the metaphysics of the people, which we must absolutely allow them and therefore outwardly respect; for to discredit it means to deprive them of it.</p> <p>This remains a common view amongst overly educated academics, who believe they have discovered a deeper truth, something more true, more fundamental than the layman who fumbles with his crude religion.</p> <p>Yet ask the enlightened philosopher, the so-called lover of wisdom, what is the meaning and purpose of existence?</p> <p>They will flounder and flail, wandering directly away from Christ, in a predictable nihilistic path towards relativism. Once you see it you cannot unsee it, the entire field of philosophy as we understand it comes crashing down.</p> <p>This is because they have no deeper truth, no first principle as a cause for their belief in reason, knowledge, and even truth itself.  They must accept all these secondary causes as primary, and somehow attempt to weave multiple axioms into a unified principle: ethics, epistemology, mathematics, beauty, art, ..., the list goes on. </p> <p>Reason is not self justifying, and can provide no defensible epistemology, let alone an ethic. </p> <p>Faith in reason is a form of self worship, imagining ourselves as unbiased observers of an objectively knowable existence and that we can reason our way to knowledge and truth. That we and our capacity to reason and observe evidence is the source of all knowledge, morality, beauty, etc.</p> <p>To connect to a deeper first principle is metanoia, the revelation of such a first cause. This cause will become the new first principle.</p> <p>And in terms of reason, from where does it arise? Where does reason come from?</p> <p>And what about morality? Or even mathematics? Or beauty?</p> <p>Are these all first principles that we must accept on faith? Or is there a deeper and unifying first principle? A unified first principle? A first principle that when accepted will be the final moment of metanoia.</p> <p>For just as there must be faith in first principles, there is necessarily a final unified first principle. It is that which we take on faith and which is the causal source of knowledge, morality, beauty, truth, mathematics, and even reason itself.</p> <p>We all necessarily have faith in a unified first principle, that which (we believe) gives rise to knowledge, morality, beauty, truth, etc. We attempt to answer with nothingness in our modern view, that is, a worship of nothingness.</p>"},{"location":"ancient-views/order-chaos/","title":"Order and Chaos","text":"<p>Dao, Daoism</p> <p>yin yang</p> <p>order, dry land, tyrant father</p> <p>chaos, water, devouring mother</p> <p>Leviathan and Behemoth</p> <p>The entirety of the archetypal system is laid out here, but most fascinating, it is not a first principle.

In the ancient Greek, it is apolytr\u014dsis meaning to ransom in full.</p> <p>Titus 11:14</p> <p>For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,  Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;  Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;  Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p> <p>Luke 21:28</p> <p>And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.</p> <p>While our modern view of redemption is that Christ died for our sins, for the wages of sin are death -- the ancient view went far deeper. In the fall of man, there were multiple rebellions where man turned away from God, his creator. Redemption is the act of God that buys us back, bringing us back under God, fulfilling what we were created to fulfill -- that is, to glorify God.</p> <p>Redemption effectively undoes the three cosmological rebellions against God:</p> <ol> <li>exile from Eden, introducing death to creation </li> <li>sin, starting with Cain and then leading to the flood, God taking HisSpirit away from man, limiting our lives to no more than a hundred and twenty years</li> <li>Babel, scattering us across the earth and confusing our language such that we no longer speak the divine language</li> </ol> <p>Importantly, each of these moments resulted in a change in cosmology, that is, the very nature of reality and the order of creation shifted. It is thus a mistake when we imagine our modern cosmology applied to earlier eras -- in truth the very fabric of reality was different.</p> <p>The most extreme example was life without death. But even in the days after Noah and prior to Babel, all men spoke the same language and \"nothing was impossible\" to man.  There was no \"language learning\" nor even such a concept.  There was no miscommunication.  Language conveyed unambiguous meaning to all. Additionally, this was prior to the new covenant and as such God's moral law was not yet written into the hearts of man. We cannot imagine what life was like in this era, as our entire conscious mind is based on a different cosmology. We can only infer from ancient text (canonical and apocryphal) what this was like -- e.g., to be placed beneath the gods (spirits), to be subject to demons, playthings of devils. For better or worse, our modern age is increasingly providing a taste of exactly this ungodly state.</p> <p>The redemption of man is thus an extreme cosmological shift, a paradigm shift in consciousness, restoring man into a state last seen in Eden. For others this is hell, which is God's mercy for the unrepentant.</p> <p>In other words, all are bought back, and while this is good news for those who bear their cross so that the old man may die, this exact redemption (buying back) is a lake of fire for those that refuse to let the old man die. This means there is no more rebellion, that time as we know it is over, and we return to our created state -- glorified, or thrown into the lake of fire. Importantly, this was understood as the exact same phenomena -- to the repentant it is divine glory, beholding the face of God, to the unrepentant it is fire, it is weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p> <p>Hell is thus not the lake of fire. The fire is the divine light of God; the uncreated energy of God. Hell is outer darkness away from God, a mercy to those who refuse God's grace, for to be in the presence of God would be unbearable pain to those holding onto sin.</p>"},{"location":"doctrines/","title":"Doctrines","text":""},{"location":"doctrines/baptism/","title":"Baptism","text":"<p>https://www.oca.org/orthodoxy/the-orthodox-faith/worship/the-sacraments/baptism</p> <p>https://orthodoxwiki.org/Baptism</p> <p>https://www.saintjohnchurch.org/orthodox-baptism-newness-of-life/</p> <p>Infant baptism </p> <p>http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/liturgics/bajis_infant_baptism.htm</p> <p>https://stpeterorthodoxchurch.com/new-to-orthodoxy/what-does-the-orthodox-church-teach-about-infant-baptism/</p> <p>Baptism beings the child into a christian family, that they will be raised as a Christian.</p> <p>https://orthodoxwiki.org/Infant_baptism</p>"},{"location":"doctrines/christ/","title":"Christ","text":"<p>Christology</p> <p>https://www.britannica.com/topic/Eastern-Orthodoxy/Doctrine</p>"},{"location":"doctrines/christ/#annunciation","title":"Annunciation","text":"<p>John 1:1-5</p> <p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

Nothingness? This is the longing of the atheist -- because the alternative is too frightful to bear. For if God is real, then man's soul   is immortal,  and by not accepting salvation,  salvation  which is freely given, how will  such a soul respond to eternity  without God to sustain them? They will seek the cold nothingness,  for the alternative is the light of  God, who they were made to glorify. Such light would be unbearable. They exist in meaningless darkness,  seeking for nothingness, turning  away from God whose light  burns their sin, their pride, yet they  hold and cling to pride,  to their resentment of God,  for their desire is for God  to erase their created soul as a mistake,  which in their pride is what they would do. God's love is here, ready to  save, and yet they still refuse, forever,  burning in pain while desperate for  the abyss of nothingness. This is hell.</p> <p>If you want to understand hell,  understand the value of your life,  the value of a single human life. Recognize the divinity of the lowliest  of human lives. Remember that our souls are immortal,  and that we  (created in the image and likeness of the creator of the universe)  will not return to nothingness. A human soul is not destined for nirvana nor moksha --  every soul is destined for truth, be it glorious, be it cold, be it fire.</p> <p>God have mercy on us.</p>"},{"location":"doctrines/justification/","title":"Justification","text":"<p>https://classicalchristianity.com/2011/02/25/on-limited-atonement/ St. Gregory of Nyssa ca. 335-394</p> <p>\u201cBut why is it,\u201d they ask, \u201cthat all men do not obtain the grace, but that, while some adhere to the Word, the portion who remain unbelieving is no small one; either because God was unwilling to bestow his benefit ungrudgingly upon all, or because He was altogether unable to do so?\u201d Now neither of these alternatives can defy criticism. For it is unworthy of God, either that He should not will what is good, or that He should be unable to do it. \u201cIf, therefore, the Faith is a good thing, why,\u201d they ask, \u201cdoes not its grace come upon all men?\u201d Now, if in our representation of the Gospel mystery we had so stated the matter as that it was the Divine will that the Faith should be so granted away amongst mankind that some men should be called, while the rest had no share in the calling, occasion would be given for bringing such a charge against this Revelation. But if the call came with equal meaning to all and makes no distinction as to worth, age, or different national characteristics (for it was for this reason that at the very first beginning of the proclamation of the Gospel they who ministered the Word were, by Divine inspiration, all at once enabled to speak in the language of any nation, viz. in order that no one might be destitute of a share in the blessings of evangelical instruction), with what reasonableness can they still charge it upon God that the Word has not influenced all mankind? </p> <p>https://orthodoxchristiantheology.com/2020/12/11/the-orthodox-doctrine-of-justification-the-biblical-teaching/</p> <p>https://orthodoxchristiantheology.com/2020/12/17/the-orthodox-doctrine-of-justification-the-patristic-and-conciliar-teaching</p> <p>Romans 8:30 also see commentary from Symeon the New Theologian:</p> <p>Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. - Romans 8:30</p> <p>It is not God\u2019s foreknowledge of those who, by their free choice and zeal, will prevail which is the cause of their victory, just as, again, it is not His knowing beforehand who will fall and be vanquished which is responsible for their defeat. Instead, it is the zeal, deliberate choice, and courage of each of us which effects the victory. Our faithlessness and sloth, our irresolution and indolence, on the other hand, comprise our defeat and perdition. So, while reclining on our bed of worldly affection and love of pleasure, let us not say: \u201cThose whom God fore-knew, them also He predestined,\u201d without perceiving just what it is we are saying. Yes, indeed, He truly knew you beforehand as inattentive and disobedient and lazy, but this is certainly not because He ordered or foreordained it that you should have no power to repent yourself nor, if you will it, to get up and obey. You, though, when you say this, are clearly calling God a liar. While He says, \u201cI came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance\u201d [Matthew 9:13], you, lazy and unwilling to turn around and repent of your evil, contradict Him, as it were, and call Him a liar Who never lies, when you make such excuses as these. \u201cThose who are going to repent\u201d, you say, \u201cwere predestined, but I am not one of them. So, let them repent therefore whom God clearly foreknew, and whom He also predestined.\u201d O what a lack of feeling! O shamelessness of soul and worse than the demons themselves!

Why do you reason to your own perdition rather than your salvation? And why do you pick out for yourselves the obscure passages of inspired Scripture and then tear them out of context and twist them in order to accomplish your own destruction? Do you not hear the Savior crying out every day: \u201cAs I live \u2026 I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live\u201d [Ezekiel 33:11]? Do you not hear Him Who says: \u201cRepent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand\u201d [Matthew 3:2]; and again: \u201cJust so, I tell you, there is joy in heaven over one sinner who repents\u201d [Luke 15:7, adapted]? Did He ever say to some: \u201cDo not repent for I will not accept you,\u201d while to others who were predestined: \u201cBut you, repent! because I knew you beforehand\u201d? Of course not! Instead, throughout the world and in every church He shouts: \u201cCome to Me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\u201d [Matthew 11:28]. Come, He says, all you who are burdened with many sins, to the One Who takes away the sin of the world; come all who thirst to the fountain which flows and never dies.</p> <p>Does He distinguish and separate anyone out, calling one to Himself as foreknown while sending the other away as not predestined? Never! Therefore, \u201cyou should not make excuses for your sins\u201d [Psalm 140:4, LXX], nor should you want to make the Apostle\u2019s words an occasion for your own destruction, but should run, all of you, to the Master Who calls you. For even if someone is a publican, or a fornicator, an adulterer, a murderer, or whatever else, the Master does not turn him away, but takes away the burden of his sins immediately and makes him free. And how does He take away the other\u2019s burden? Just as He once took away that of the paralytic when He said to the latter: \u201cMy son, your sins are forgiven\u201d [Matthew 9:2], and the man was immediately relieved of his burden and, in addition, received the cure of his body.</p> <p>So then, let everyone who wants approach Him, and let the one say: \u201cSon of David, have mercy on me\u201c; and, if he hears, \u201cWhat do you want Me to do for you?\u201d let him say quickly, \u201cLord, let me receive my sight,\u201d and right away he will hear, \u201cSo I desire. Receive your sight\u201d [Luke 18:38-42]. Let another say, \u201cLord, my daughter\u201c\u2013i.e. my soul\u2013\u201cis severely possessed by a demon\u201d [Matthew 15:22], and he will hear: \u201cI will come to heal her\u201d [Matthew 8:7]. If someone is hesitant and does not wish to approach the Master, even if He comes to him and says, \u201cFollow Me\u201d [Matthew 9:9], then let him follow Him as the publican once did, abandoning his counting tables and his avarice, and, I am sure, He shall make of him, too, an evangelist rather than a tax collector. If someone else is a paralytic, lying for years in sloth, carelessness, and love of pleasure, and if he should see another, be it the Master Himself or one of His disciples, come to him and ask, \u201cDo you want to be healed?\u201d [John 5:2-7], let him receive the word joyfully and reply immediately: \u201cYes, Lord, but I have no man to put me into the pool of repentance.\u201d And then if he should hear, \u201cRise, take up your bed, and follow me,\u201d let him get up right away and run after the footsteps of the One Who has called him from on high.</p> <p>Now, if someone does not wish, whether like the sinful woman to embrace the feet of Christ [Luke 7:38], or like the prodigal son to run back to Him with burning repentance [Luke 15:11ff], or like the woman with a hemorrhage and bowed with infirmity [Luke 8:43 and 13:11] even to approach Him, why does he then make excuses for his sins by saying, \u201cThose whom He foreknew, them also\u201c\u2013and them alone!\u2013\u201cHe called\u201c?</p> <p>One may perhaps reasonably reply to the person so disposed that \u201cGod, Who is before eternity and Who knows all things before creating them, also knew you beforehand, knew that you would not obey Him when He called, that you would not believe in His promises and in His words, yet still, even while knowing this, He \u201cbowed the heavens and came down\u201d [Psalm 18:19] and became man, and for your sake has come to the place where you lie prone. Indeed, visiting you many times every day, sometimes in His own Person and sometimes as well through His servants, He exhorts you to get up from the calamity in which you lie and to follow Him Who ascends to the Kingdom of Heaven and enter it together with Him. But you, you still refuse to do it.</p> <p>Then tell me, who is responsible for your perdition and disobedience? You, who refuse to obey and who will not follow your Master, or God Himself Who made you, Who knew beforehand that you would not obey Him, but would instead abide in your hardened and impenitent heart? I think that you will certainly say, \u201cHe is not responsible, but I am myself,\u201d because God\u2019s forbearance is not the cause of our hardness, Rather, it is our own lack of compliance.</p> <p>For God knows all things beforehand, both past and present at once, and everything which is going to happen in the future up to the end of the world. He sees them as already present, because in and through Him all things hold together [Colossians 1:17]. Indeed, just as today the emperor takes in with a glance those who race and who wrestle in the area, but does not thereby make himself responsible for the victory of the winners or the failure of the losers\u2013the zeal, or in other cases the slackness, of the contestants being cause of their victory or defeat\u2013understand with me that it is just so with God Himself. When He endowed us with free will, giving commandments to teach us instead how we must oppose our adversaries, He left it to the free choice of each either to oppose and vanquish the enemy, or to relax and be miserably defeated by him. Nor does He leave us entirely to ourselves\u2013for He knows the weakness of human nature\u2013but rather is present Himself with us and, indeed, allies Himself with those who choose to struggle, and mysteriously imbues us with strength, and Himself, not we, accomplishes the victory over the adversary. This the earthly emperor is unable to do, since he is himself also a man, and is rather in need himself of assistance, just as we require it, too.</p> <p>God, on the other hand, Who is mighty and invincible, becomes, as we just said, an ally of those who willingly choose to do battle with the enemy, and He establishes them as victors over the cunning of the devil. He does not, however, compel any who do not so choose to this war, in order that He not destroy the power of choice which is proper to our reasoning nature, made according to His own image, and bring us down to the level of unreasoning brutes. Thus God, as we have explained, sees us all at once as if in an arena, just like the earthly emperor looks down on the athletes in competition. But, while the latter does not know who will lose and who will win until he sees the outcome of their contest and, though he may prepare the victors\u2019 crowns beforehand, he still does not know to whom he is going to present them; the King of Heaven, on the other hand, knows from before the ages exactly who the victors and vanquished are going to be. This is why He said to those who asked Him if they could sit at His right hand and His left in His glory: \u201cIt is not mine to give to you\u201d [Matthew 20:23], but that it will be given instead to those for whom it was prepared.</p> <p>This therefore what Paul himself also knew when he said rightly:</p> <p>Those whom God foreknew, the same He also predestined; and those whom He predestined, He also called; and those whom He called, the same He also glorified. [Romans 8:29-30]</p> <p>It is not God\u2019s foreknowledge of those who, by their free choice and zeal, will prevail which is the cause of their victory, just as, again, it is not His knowing beforehand who will fall and be vanquished which is responsible for their defeat. Instead, it is the zeal, deliberate choice, and courage of each of us which effects the victory. Our faithlessness and sloth, our irresolution and indolence, on the other hand, comprise our defeat and perdition. So, while reclining on our bed of worldly affection and love of pleasure, let us not say: \u201cThose whom God fore-knew, them also He predestined,\u201d without perceiving just what it is we are saying.

When did anyone ever hear of one of them saying such a thing? Where was it ever heard that a demon blamed God for its own damnation? Let us then not blame the demons, for here there is a human soul which thinks up blasphemies even worse than theirs.</p> <p>So tell me, where did you learn that you did not belong to those who are foreknown and predestined to become conformed to the image of God\u2019s glory? Tell me, who told you this? Was it, maybe, God Who announced this to you, Himself, or by one of His prophets, or through an angel? \u201cNo,\u201d you say, \u201cbut I do suppose that I am not predestined to salvation, and that all my effort would be in vain.\u201d And why do you not believe instead with all your soul that God has sent His only-begotten Son on the earth for your sake alone, and for your salvation, that He knew you beforehand and predestined you to become His brother and co-heir? Why are you not eager to love Him with all your heart and to honor His saving commandments? Why do you not rather believe that, having been slaughtered for your sake, He will never abandon you, nor allow you to perish? Do you not hear Him saying: \u201cCan a woman forget her suckling child . . . yet I will not forget you\u201d [Isaiah 49:15]? So, if by anticipation you judge yourself unworthy, and willfully separate yourself from the flock of Christ\u2019s sheep, you should understand that it is none other than you who are the cause of your own damnation.</p> <p>Therefore, casting out of our souls all faithlessness, sloth, and hesitation, let us draw near with all our heart, with unhesitating faith and burning desire, like slaves who have been newly purchased with precious blood. Indeed, with reverence for the price paid on our behalf, and with love for our Master Who paid it, and as having accepted His love for us, let us recognize that, if He had not wished to save by means of Himself us who have been purchased, He would not have come down to earth, nor would He have been slain for our sake. But, as it is written, He has done this because He wills that all should be saved. Listen to Him say it Himself: \u201cI did not come to judge the world, but to save the world\u201d [John 12:17]. - \"Second Ethical Discourse\"</p> <ul> <li>Symeon the New Theologian</li> </ul> <p>Read more commentaries at https://catenabible.com/com/60284b9f365356511a1132fa</p>"},{"location":"doctrines/mediator/","title":"Christ as the Mediator","text":"<p>For there is one God and one Mediator  between God and men,  the Man Christ Jesus,  (1 Tim. 2:5)</p> <p>https://blogs.ancientfaith.com/glory2godforallthings/2020/02/15/the-one-mediator-and-the-sacraments/</p> <p>Christ mediates between us and  God the Father.

Man is something to be overcome. What have you done to overcome him? All things before you have produced something beyond themselves, and would you be the ebb of this great flood? Would you rather go back to the animal than transcend man? What is  the ape to man? A jest or a bitter shame. And just that shall man be to the Superman, a jest or a bitter shame.

Seraphim Rose).</p> <p>And even earlier than Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky, we find other prophetic voices such as Heinrich Heine.

There will be played in Germany a drama compared to which the French Revolution will seem but an innocent idyll.</p> <p>... And the hour will come. As on the steps of an amphitheatre, the nations will group themselves around Germany to witness the terrible combat.</p> <p>Clearly the modern view traces back even further, into the reign of terror of the French Revolution.

We see this same destructive revolutionary view in the early scholastic period, articulated through  millenarianism  that grew especially popular in that era.</p> <p>For example the  Joachimites in the 13th century imagined three ages (based on the trinity: Father, Son, Holy Spirit), and that they were entering the 3rd and final age. Joachim believed that the end of the Christian era would be in the year 1260, which would see the coming of the Antichrist, followed by a thousand year utopia (the age defined by the Holy Spirit). These views were (perhaps unconsciously) reflected in Nazism, that the 3rd Reich will rule for a thousand years.</p> <p>As Fr. Seraphim Rose notes,</p> <p>revolutionary conclusions were drawn later by men of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, by the Franciscan Spirituals, who recognized in Joachim the new John the Baptist, heralding St. Francis as the novus dux of the last dispensation, even as the \"new Christ\".</p> <p>Any such view of a \"new Christ\" was anathema to orthodox Christianity, yet this corruption in western Christianity was one of many that led inevitably to the Protestant Reformation, itself another outburst of the destructive revolutionary spirit.

All before Christ were lost in darkness, subject to principalities and powers, holding desperately to prophetic hope. And look how they followed when He called,</p> <p>Matthew 4:18-22</p> <p>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</p> <p>And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.</p> <p>And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</p> <p>And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.</p> <p>Many are called, but few are chosen.  Note carefully those that did not follow the call.  And let us reflect honestly and humbly upon the story of the rich young man. A story more apt today than ever before,</p> <p>Matthew 19:16-24</p> <p>And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</p> <p>And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</p> <p>He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p> <p>The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</p> <p>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</p> <p>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p> <p>The rich young man is perfectly endemic to our modern age, to modern Christians, who are very much like this rich young man.  By any account, this young man is being honest when he says he is fulfilling the mosaic law.  We can imagine he was giving his tithing gladly and generously, and was honest and kind with everyone.  Yet still he knew something was missing. </p> <p>Without understanding, he was violating the first commandment, and had placed his possessions -- his worldly status -- above God.</p> <p>Likewise, many modern Christians want the worldly benefits of the Christian lifestyle, and like this young man are fulfiling the worldly commandments, but they have not yet known God. They are not following the greatest commandment: to love God with all your heart, mind, and soul. And as we see in the gospel of Luke, it is not just wealth that we place above God,</p> <p>Luke 9:57-62</p> <p>And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</p> <p>And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</p> <p>And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house. And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</p> <p>If we're honest, how often are we placing our careers, our families, our politics, above the worship of God? Contrast that to the apostles who dropped their fishing nets and followed Jesus.

And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,  Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</p> <p>Imagine such faith, not only answering when His church called, but selling all possessions and devoting their lives to Christ and His church.

And all of this was an attempt to allow for human free will in a Christian context. In the end, the Pelagian view  was deemed heretical   (see Canon V from the Council of 418).

Later, the Remonstrant Arminian view was explicitly condemned   at the   Synod of Dort  which is what led to the articulation of the  five points of Calvinism  (known by the mnemonic acronym TULIP).</p> <p>And exactly as the condemnation of Pelagianism resulted in the emergence of semi-Pelagianism, the condemnation of Remonstrant Arminianism led inevitably to a rationalistic Arminianism. In the century after Dort there was a migration away from strict monergism but not stopping at rational Arminianism, instead it inevitably produced  deism,  itself a stepping stone into the postmodern malaise and meaning crisis. As a result, and as astute Calvinists have maintained, any view that takes away from the complete sovereignty of God (and irresistable grace) inevitably leads to  deism, naturalism, and ultimately to what  Nietzsche  described as the death of God in the hearts of man.</p> <p>Arminianism is semi-Pelegian</p> <p>In rationalistic terms, the Arminian view grants to man a small ability to choose good (a step towards salvation) that is independent of God. Even if we say this is only 0.01% man and 99.99% God, this is semi-Pelegian by definition.</p> <p>Importantly this view emerges inevitably as a reaction to the strict monergistic doctrine of reprobation. In rationalistic terms, monergism insists that God is 100% responsible for man's salvation, but reprobation is to say God is 100% responsible for man's condemnation. Thus man's will is not sufficient to participate in his own salvation, because all was predetermined.</p> <p>The orthodox view of synergism is to say God is 100% responsible for man's salvation while conversely man is 100% responsible for his own condemnation. And thus man willfully participates in his own salvation.</p> <p>While we can easily dispense with the semi-Pelagian  views of Arminianism,  if we are truly concerned with truth,  then we are left with an ongoing  debate between   strict monergism  and  orthodox synergism. It seems as if  either John Calvin and the reformers were wrong,  or John Chrysostom and all of the church fathers were wrong. And while both sides have plenty of scriptural support,  all it takes is one counterexample to show an interpretation as false.</p>"},{"location":"modern-views/free-will/#arminianism","title":"Arminianism","text":"<p>Arminian synergism, which is similar to the Roman Catholic view of synergism, contains plenty of scriptural support.

From Pelagianism to Arminianism to the various councils/synods  condeming them -- the pattern is as timeless as Christianity itself. Importantly, this confirms the  observation that Arminianism is  contained with Calvinism. These are clearly two sides of the same coin. The five points of Calvinism contain within their strict dogma  a seed of semi-Pelagianism, be it Arminianism or Molinism or  whatever the -ism.</p> <p>This is necessarily true because the five points of Calvinism (TULIP) are true from a transcendent level of analysis, and not the particular level of human  behavior. Rationality itself is contingent upon this transcendent level of analysis, and while we can make sense of TULIP through transcendent categories, we cannot apply it to particulars, say, to your own prayer life (other than as a reminder of God's absolute sovereignty, which is also affirmed in orthodox synergism).</p> <p>This is in fact what it means for Christ to be the mediator between the high and the low, between fallen man and God the father -- because He is unifying the particular (man's will) with the transcendent (divine will).</p> <p>Resolving this ongoing reactionary cycle requires Christ. The revealed truth of Christ with His divine will and human will, is the unification of the truths of monergism (e.g., of irresistable grace) acted out in the truths of synergism. Traditionally this is what is meant by orthodox synergism.</p>"},{"location":"modern-views/free-will/#orthodox-view","title":"Orthodox View","text":"<p>The Biblical narrative is very clear  on two points:</p> <p>1 - God has ultimate sovereignty, and</p> <p>2 - man has free will.</p> <p>The structure of the Biblical narrative  affirms both points. God is a character in the  Bible, as is man,  who was created in the image  and likeness of God. This is not an impersonal God of deism. God is not only personal, but our very  notion of personhood is from God,  that is, we possess personhood because  we ware made in the image and likeness of God. Our free will exists in that we  participate in His will. And His will is done.  He is the transcendent source of all creation. Even God hardening (strengthening)  Pharoah's heart,   this is what allowed Pharoah  to follow his own free will into   certain destruction.</p> <p>These two revealed truths, of God's sovereignty and man's free will, create a potential dilemma, as effectively both sides of the free will debate are strongly affirmed in the Bible. And thus any interpretation of scripture which denies one side can be declared false. And the question of reconciling these seemingly contrary views is left as a divine mystery, one that parallels the life and character of Jesus Christ.</p> <p>This in effect is affirmed in the Chalcedonian Definition  (from the  fourth ecumenical council) that Christ has two wills and that Christ is both God and man. This necessarily implies that man's free  will not only exists but that it  can be redeemed in Christ. Note also how the human will of Christ  not only was tempted by Satan, but also  participates in the will of the father,  with perfect obedience so as to glorify God (the father). Christ's human will participated harmoniously with His divine will, and did so in a way that makes it possible for us to participate harmoniously with His divine sovereign will. By coming to Christ we find in Christ  an answer to the free will  question;  and we find affirmation that any interpretation  that denies or compromises free will or that denies or compromises God's ultimate sovereignty, any such compromised views are as heretical and false as denying that Christ is both God and man.</p> <p>Only by affirming that Christ is both God and man, such that man is both free and completely subject to God's sovereignty, can we make sense of the Bible. This is what is traditionally known as  synergism  from the Greek synergoi, as Saint Paul writes,</p> <p>1 Corinthians 3:9</p> <p>\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b3\u03ac\u03c1 \u1f10\u03c3\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03af\u00b7 \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b3\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5.</p> <p>Theou gar esmen synergoi; Theou ge\u00f4rgion, Theou oecodom\u00ea este.</p> <p>For we are fellow workers with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.</p> <p>Orthodox synergism is notably different from Roman Catholic synergism as well as rational Arminian synergism, in that the orthodox view affirms God's absolute sovereignty through Christ's divine will, while simultaneously affirming man's free will through Christ's human will. This does not compromise on irresistible grace nor total depravity, nor any of the five points of Calvinism (though it does disagree with reprobation). In fact, it becomes clear that Calvinism speaks of Christ's divine will while making no claims about Christ's human will and the necessary implications to man's free will. Or rather, this is why Calvinists find reprobation (double predestination) so controversial.</p> <p>Ultimately, the creator of the universe became flesh, became man -- the divine Logos incarnate. And as such lived with sinless perfection, participating in the divine will through His human will.</p> <p>While orthodox synergism has often been maligned and misrepresented  (conflated with Roman Catholic synergism or Arminian semi-Pelagian heresies),  the core doctrine of orthodox synergy remains crucial  and necessary to the truth of the Biblical narrative.</p> <p>In fact, there were attempts at reconciliation between the early reformed church  and the Eastern Orthodox church. Unfortunately this did not lead to unification,  although it did bear good fruits in what is known as  The Confession of Dositheus  which better articulated the Eastern Orthodox positions  with respect to reformed theology more generally.

from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.

This is all despite explicit warnings in that same Book of Revelation not to add or remove anything, which is a clear warning against modern eisegesis,</p> <p>Revelation 22:18-19</p> <p>I testify to everyone who hears the words of prophecy in this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.

Zero as a number and a placeholder did not exist.  And perhaps coincidentally, when zero was finally adopted in the west, that was about the same time that chiliasm emerged (during the early scholastic period).</p> <p>Prior to that, and through all of church history, chilia et\u0113 was understood symbolically as an age or an era. The same way we say \"back in the day\" to refer to a period of time and not a literal 1 day, ta chilia et\u0113 was referring to an age, specifically the messianic age.</p> <p>The interesting part of this passage was not the thousand years, but rather the references to old testament messianic prophecies (such as from the Book of Daniel) -- which would have been common knowledge to the people in the early church. To the early Christians, this era known as ta chilia et\u0113 was the messianic age, the penultimate age before final judgment, the time between the first and second coming of Christ.</p> <p>Contrast this with modern millennialist views which do not reference the messianic age at all, because they need a separate name to refer to our current age. In practice they'll refer to our current age as the \"church age\", which is separate from the future millennium -- effectively inventing a new age to match their eisegesis.</p> <p>The earliest form of modern millennialism is probably the utopian views of   the Joachimites   which arose in the thirteenth century, proposing  a new \"age of the Holy Spirit\" heralded by   Francis of Assisi  such that in the year 1260 the Christian age would end and a utopian era would arrive. While condemned by the church this view influenced and continues to influence modern culture,   e.g., we see this clearly in  the modern new age movement, such as the so-called  Age of Aquarius. However, the most prevalent form of millennialism arose in the 19th century, both from the  Bible Student movement,  a precursor to the Jehovah's Witnesses,  as well as protestant dispensationalist  views promoting what is known as a pre-tribulation rapture.</p> <p>These modern chiliastic views have increased in popularity and are typically categorized based on when Christ would return.

The nature of work is fundamental to creation itself, including planning, ordering, and rest. That is the nature of reality as He created it. And He saw that it was good.</p> <p>Despite the fall of man, work itself is good. Man's purpose is to work, to work in such a way as to glorify God, participating in His will.</p> <p>Money is a technology, a social technology that allows for one person to save and then use that saved money to direct and influence the work of others. Simply by participating in a market, one is valuing some goods and services over others. And it is in this influence that the morality of money and wealth can be seen, both in money production and usage.</p> <p>What makes a money good and not sinful? Money is good when it is produced through work, work that glorifies God. This means that money cannot be used as a system of control. God gave us free will so that we may come to him willfully, so that our God-given will can participate in His divine will.</p> <p>Good money is the fruit of good work, and it belongs to God (as all things do). It is never your money, never your wealth, but it is in your possession temporarily, and you are a steward for God's wealth; God has granted you the responsibility to lead and influence the work of others.

Bitcoin includes proof of work for transaction settlement, and in fact this is incorporated into issuance (money production). The same work backs both. Should these have been separate? Would a separate proof of work for transaction settlement be beneficial? Or is it necessary to include them together?  By including them together, it provides the minimum proof of work necessary for the monetary system to sustain.</p>"},{"location":"modern-views/money-wealth/#tithing","title":"Tithing","text":"<p>Tithing means literally one tenth, and in our modern view we view this as 10% of ones gross income given to the church.</p> <p>In the early church, tithing was adopted from Jewish tradition which involved three tithes,</p> <ol> <li>annual tithe to the priests</li> <li>annual feast tithe to the temple </li> <li>3rd year tithe to the poor</li> </ol> <p>These practices and the history of tithing goes back centuries before the mosaic law, with the earliest biblical references of Abraham giving a tithe to Melchizedek,</p> <p>Genesis 14:18-20</p> <p>And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.</p> <p>And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:</p> <p>And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.
