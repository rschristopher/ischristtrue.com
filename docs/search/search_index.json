As such,  many young and curious seekers of truth  approach the  fundamental questions  of life and fully expect  to find answers amongst the  philosophers  and  intellectuals  of the modern age. For surely they must have answers --  these are afterall, the   most fundamental questions  one could ever ask.</p> <p>Unfortunately, what we  find amongst the learned  philosophers and professional  intellectuals of our age  is a nihilistic  progression of   dead ideas,  a history of the failures  of past philosophers to answer  any of the fundamental questions --  and we're left with  rationalizations and word games to  desensitize honest seekers,  to soothe them into  accepting intellectual failures  and the inevitable nihilism  that follows.</p> <p>Find one of these so-called  experts and ask them yourself -- Can we know anything? What does it mean to know? What do you, personally, know?</p> <p>They may tell you about  epistemology,  about \"justified true belief\",  about the   Gettier problem,  and you'll find yourself  reading the likes of  Nietzsche,   Hegel,  and maybe some  Wittgenstein. Then maybe  Camus  and   Foucault  if you had the temprament for it. And now all you know is that  the mere concept of  objective truth doesn't  actually exist or at least  is not knowable, except  we can't even know that,  because to claim that is  itself an objective truth claim.</p> <p>We now know less than we did  before we started. We can now   either pretend everything is  rational and we can call ourselves  a \"realist\" or a  \"pragmatist\",  or we  and embrace the esoteric  spiritual systems all competing  for our attention,  maybe they have some answers. Maybe   Buddhists  have objective truth or  maybe any of the various  gurus  or   antigurus. Maybe we revert back to  secular liberalism, and find  ourselves yearning for the  comforts of ancient religious  beliefs we just can't  bring ourselves to literally believe.</p> <p>For what is belief other than how  we act in the face of the  pain and suffering of life? What is it that we actually believe? And why do none of the  modern belief systems  have any foundational answers  and always seem to bring us  further and further away  from those fundamental questions  we originally wanted to answer?</p> <p>the light, the light ~ the seeking, the searching ~ in chaos, in chaos</p>"},{"location":"truth/#knowing-truth","title":"Knowing Truth","text":"<p>This should be a simple question,  is there objective knowable truth? Does truth exist?</p> <p>In the modern view,  there is no objective knowable truth. There is word games. There is suffering. There is power and oppression. There is the deconstruction of  everything, even deconstructionism itself. Once again, we move further and further  away from the fundamental questions.</p> <p>If you are at all serious about pursuing  and knowing truth,  you may want to consider an alternative  to the fashionable trends of modern  philosophy which all seems to aim  away from fundamental questions,  as if on purpose. You may want to consider that the  entire enlightenment project  has yielded exactly this assault  on the fundamental questions,  and that it is anti-Christian in  its aim, from the secular humanist  with their watered down  Christian traditions,  to the pragmatists and devout  atheists, all the way to the esoteric  spiritual revivalism that springs  forth inevitably from the  spiritually dead atheists  and the spiritually weak humanists. All of these seemingly disparate worldviews  share a singular and notable feature;  to weaken and reject Christianity,  which just so happens to be the origin   of \"knowable objective truth\". For those who still hold a belief in  knowable objective truth and yet  reject Christianity, you are operating  on the fumes of a Christian worldview,  and you'll find only absurdity at the  other end of your venture.</p> <p>To be clear, if you claim to be a  rationalist,  an  empiricist,  someone who follows  science  and does not believe in  anything you can't  see with your own eyes,  then you will find yourself  unmoored from any first principles  necessary for even a pretense  of objective truth, and you've  probably numbed yourself to those  fundamental questions and you simply  stopped asking them with any humility. You can ignore the fundamental questions,  but non-belief in an otherwise \"unseen\" reality   doesn't negate the existence of that reality. You don't live in a mechanistic universe,  because fundamental questions are  not mechanistic and yet still exist  and are still fundamental. You don't live in absurdist universe,  accepting absurdism is merely to  abandon reason and will. And you certainly don't live in a   postmodern  universe.</p> <p>The postmodern \"deconstructions\" of  modern views  will yield absurdity,  but they are still apt critiques  of the rationalism we see in  secular culture. There is indeed a patriarchal hierarchy  which is the foundation for any and all  truth claims. There is a normative system of power. It indeed can't be otherwise. The patriarchy, it turns out, is real! And yet it doesn't seem to be man-made,  it is in the fabric of reality. On some level the postmodernists  know this, and still reject it  (and hence reject truth itself).</p> <p>They'll say, \"my truth\", \"your truth\",  because truth to them is relative,  a language game of power. Yet we can't say this without making yet  another objective truth claim. Hypocrisy would bother them if they  believed in objective truth. But really, they are assaulting the very  idea of knowable objective truth,  reducing it to self worship. And even this moves them paradoxically  closer to actual truth (that truth  involves a person and a relationship).</p> <p>For truth to have any meaning,  then truth must transcend all subjective  perspectives. Something is true if it is objectively true,  and knowledge of this objectivity  is what brings people to \"the Truth\".</p> <p>Modern views understand  truth as an attribute,  that something is either true or it is not. But in practice,  truth is experienced in very personal ways,  and not at all confined to sense perceptions. We once understood this in our culture,  that truth is revealed to you personally.</p> <p>Ancient views  understood truth as a spirit,  which means Truth was  something akin to personhood. If there is a spirit of truth,  then we should not ask,  \"what is true?\"  we ought to ask  \"who is truth?\" In fact, as we shall see,  this is the only way  we can even hope to arrive  at knowable objective truth.</p>"},{"location":"truth/#spirit-of-truth","title":"Spirit of Truth","text":"<p>Truth, or the spirit of truth,  like any spirit,  can be thought of as a  pattern of reality. A pattern of reality that is as  objective as it is real  (and not  a veil of delusions  or perceptions). In other words, that which  is objectively real is  the spirit we are referring. And rather than a what,  truth is better understood as a who.</p> <p>A spirit is any pattern of reality with   a consciousness It has agency and   self awareness. It has personal attributes.</p> <p>If you haven't thought of a spirit  in this way, and instead  think of spirits as  translucent ghosts that don't   interact with our world but hover  about --  this is most certainly not a spirit,  this is a childish caricature  and it demonstrates the unquestioned  nihilism that possesses our  conventional wisdom. Anyone can \"see\" a spirit, if not directly  through symbolism or iconography,  then through patterns of reality  over time. A spirit is just that, a pattern of  reality that has conscious agency.</p> <p>Think of the spirit of a city. A city over time will grow and  move about like an amoeba  (though we rarely think of it this way). Such an entity reacts to the outside  world beyond its \"body\",  with sense organs and means  with which to actualize its will. In a secular worldview we might refer  to the \"emergent\" patterns and behavior  of a complex system or ideology,  or Foucault's panopticon. But the word \"emergence\" is what if  not consciousness? It might make demands of us,  we might participate in or  be mere components of this   \"emergent\" consciousness --  the same way the bacteria in your  gut are an integral part of the  emergent consciousness that is known  as \"you\". And thankfully, these  bacteria participate in the emergence  (that we call consciousness)  known as \"you\".</p> <p>Understood properly, we can see spirits  everywhere, in all manner of systems   that we interact with and participate in. These are patterns of reality over time,  plainly visible to all humans throughout  the ages and ages -- and yet  seemingly invisible to our modern  biased mechanistic thinking,  because we ignore  the consciousness of anything other  than ourselves and other human beings  (if even that). But everywhere in nature, in our own  interactions and what we observe around us,  this \"emergence\" of consciousness is everywhere.</p> <p>Spirits everywhere, even in the most simple  systems, such as a leaf turning to face  the sun. In our secular mechanistic presuppositions  we imagine this as purely \"natural causes\",  as if that explained anything.</p> <p>We often play word games with what are  objectively spirits making themselves  known to us. Spirits have implicit meaning, beauty,  and functions  that transcend the limits  of a mechanistic worldview. Those trapped in a   mechanistic worldview are blind to  the everpresent spirits in front of their  own face, pretending with  absurd pride that humans are the originators  of all the beauty and meaning  they perceive, that only the functions  of the natural world are real  (and some deny even that).</p> <p>But even so, even if only the causal functions  of these complex emergent patterns are  real, then is that itself not clear  evidence of spirits that anyone can see? If you look upon a thunderstorm do you see  the entirety of the storm all at once? No, it is a pattern over time, a spirit. And it is much like your own consciousness,  a pattern of reality over time. Your consciousness emerges from the  complex interactions from your   body and mind;  much like the thunderstorm emerges  from the complex interactions  of water vapor, pressure, and electricity.</p> <p>Who then is the Spirit of Truth?</p> <p>He is the source  of all things as they are,  all patterns, simple and complex,  all that was, is, and will be --  including our own bodies and minds --  this is the Spirit of Truth. What kind of being, what kind of spirit,  could encompass all?</p> <p>Well, turns out there's only a handful of  possible answers. Either He exists, or doesn't. And if He does exist,  He is either knowable, or not.</p> <p>This somewhat crude classification  can handily separate the multitude  of religious worldviews and metaphysical  paradigms into a useful filter, as ultimately  we are only concerned with the existence  of a divine Spirit of Truth   that is knowable.</p> <p>If the Spirit of Truth does not exist,  or is not knowable to us,  then gone too is any hope of any defensible  epistemology. In other words, we can't know anything and  there cannot be knowable truth about ourselves  or the universe without a Spirit of Truth   making knowledge available to us.</p> <p>Whoever this divine Spirit of Truth is,  this universal pattern of reality,  He grants us knowledge  of ourselves and the world we live in. Importantly, we are now  at the limits of logic  and reason. For logic and reason cannot contain  in themselves   that which gives rise to logic and reason. Logic and reason are not self-sustaining,  they do not grant us knowledge of truth. They are but artifacts of our consciousness,  the means with which we make sense of the  world around us. The divine truth, this Spirit of Truth,  must be the source of logic and reason  (which are merely   the means given to us to make sense  of the world).</p>"},{"location":"truth/#revealed-truth","title":"Revealed Truth","text":"<p>As we cannot reach objective and knowable truth  through reason and logic alone,  then truth can only  be revealed. And this revelation of truth can only  happen through communion, that is,  relationship between ourselves and  the Spirit of Truth.</p> <p>What is our relationship to such a spirit?</p> <p>This we can only know by revelation. By asking and receiving an answer.</p>"},{"location":"truth/#meaning-and-morality","title":"Meaning and Morality","text":"<p>Just as knowledge depends  on a firm foundation  of the Truth, which as we have seen  can only be revealed -- so too  are morality as well as its cousin:  meaning (as in, the meaning of life). In other words, we must necessarily  believe that  Truth exists  in order that we can know anything,  as well as know what is good,  and know the meaning of anything.</p> <p>Truth claims, as revealed to us,  contain not only the causal functions  that materialists misattribute to  \"natural causes\"  (saying something is \"natural\"  doesn't actually explain anything) --  truth claims also contain meaning  and morality, in other words, values  of what is good, and what is not. This should not be surprising since  revelatory truth cane from a relationship  with a spirit that is   (necessarily) the source of all  that is. Just as we share truth claims with  each other,  so too does the Spirit of Truth  share with us.</p> <p>What we understand as morality  is intractable from a truth claim. All truth claims consist of  causal functionality,  morality,   meaning,  and even beauty.</p> <p>If you cannot understand the meaning  of even the most basic of things,  such as a chair or a cup,  then how could you possibly   hope to understand the  meaning of your life? Let alone the meaning of  the suffering and death  of life? Importantly, by denying knowable  objective truth, you deny  morality, meaning, and even beauty --  you will be left with the inversion  of beauty and morality,  which is fashion and relativism.</p> <p>Seeking truth is then not an  idle hobby of armchair philosophers. Seeking truth is to orient your entire  life into a relationship with God,  with the Spirit of Truth,  imbuing your life with meaning  sufficient to endure the suffering  of this world.</p>"},{"location":"truth/#antithesis-of-truth","title":"Antithesis of Truth","text":"<p>The alternative to truth,  popular in all modern universities,  and especially in philosophy classrooms,  is relativism and apathy  towards truth, which is to say,  that there is no objective knowable truth,  which is the same as saying there is  no such thing as truth.</p> <p>Even the strong rationalists with their  weapons of reason and empiricism,  will shrink in their seats  when confronted with a fundamental   question. A young student may go to such  experts of philosophy  (those proclaimed lovers of wisdom)  looking for answers  to the fundamental questions of life;  and instead they will get nothing  but a history of anti-Christian ideas. Here, young seeker,  here is a list of ideas   that show how complicated   is the history of even the word  truth.</p> <p>\"But what is the answer?\"  a young seeker might demand.</p> <p>\"Who am I to tell?\"</p> <p>\"I thought you were the expert!\"</p> <p>Imagine an engineering professor  behaving this way.

As universities continue   the nihilistic degredation  of truth, that is exactly what the  future will be.</p> <p>You might object to the above   as an imperfect metaphor,  because engineering and airplanes  are physical things with known  attributes and answers --   surely fundamental questions cannot  have such ready answers! Yet the entire field of engineering  sits atop  an assumption of a knowable objective  truth, a metaphysical claim,  all is dependent on objective  truth, and we all know this. It cannot, not even the math that  explains aerodynamic lift,   exist independently without  a foundation of knowable truth. How strange that   our modern view  would only be confident in  the fruits but not the tree  from which they grow.</p> <p>Beware those who cannot answer  the fundamental questions  they proclaim to study.

On what happens to our immortal soul  after death.</p> <p>There is a longing by nihilists  -- from  the humanists who don't consider  themselves nihilists, to the  realists who scoff at the very idea --  that after death is nothingness. They don't just believe this,   they yearn for this. And note when they say,  \"I'll return back to where I was  before I was born\". They believe they came from a  great nothingness,  that their entire being  was created from nothingness  -- and they wonder why the  astute theists will point out  that they secretly believe in God  (for who else creates ex nihilo?)</p> <p>But is this really the end fate  of a human soul?  To return to nothingness? Of course they yearn for this,  because any serious thinker  will feel in their soul  a terrible fear, a fear of immortality,  a fear of God.</p> <p>The naive half-educated \"intellectuals\"  of our time imagine immortality  to be a good and desirable thing,   but that it is just the  fantasy of \"less evolved\"  superstitious Christians. That they are more evolved and accept  the truth of their nothingness. But this, as we will see, is itself  a feel-good fantasy. Note these same \"intellectuals\"  will take seriously   trans-hunanist  arguments  and want to \"upload\" their consciousness  into a machine.</p> <p>Truth is, Christians fear immortality,  because they fear God -- they fear  the judgment that is due. Because they know, deep down, that they  are unworthy of His grace. And that only through the intercession  of Christ will they receive salvation.</p> <p>As much as some pious half-hearted  Christians imagine themselves as already  saved, deep down they know,  that it was us  who crucified the Son of God. The creator of the universe became man,  and we killed him. And let's be clear, the creator of  the universe didn't just appear as   a symbol, but became man --  the totality of God fit within  a single human being. For we were created in the image  and likeness of God.</p> <p>A single human life is worth more to God  than the entire cosmos. The essence of God cannot be contained  in all of the stars in existence,  let alone the person of the son. And yet, there He was. The creator of all, born in a manger.</p> <p>The human being is immortal, and still  retains even after the fall,  an immortal soul. We once beheld the face of God,  and we shone with our own radiance,  with no shame or vulnerability in  our being. It is after the fall, turning away  from God, did we see our material  bodily nature, our vulnerability,  our nakedness. And in our sin of pride, of wanting  to be as God,  was death set upon creation.</p> <p>And so, what happens to such exalted  creatures, made in the image and likeness  of God, when we die? Nothingness? This is the desire of the atheist --  because the alternative is to frightful  to bear. For if God is real, then man's soul   is immortal,  and by not accepting salvation,  salvation that  which is freely given, how will  such a soul respond to eternity  without God to sustain them? They will seek the cold nothingness,  for the alternative is the light of  God, who they were made to glorify. Such light would be unbearable. They exist in meaningless darkness,  seeking for nothingness, turning  away from God whose light  burns their sin, their pride, yet they  hold and cling to pride,  to their resentment of God,  the God who won't let them return  to nothingness, for that is  to erase the creation as a mistake,  which in their pride is what they would do. God's love is there, ready to  save, and yet they still refuse, forever,  burning in pain while desperate for  the abyss of nothingness. This is hell.</p> <p>If you want to understand hell,  understand the value of your life,  the value of a single human life. Recognize the divinity of the lowliest  of human lives.
