There is word games. There is a will to power. There is power and oppression. There is the deconstruction of a  everything into games of power  and oppression.</p> <p>To be clear, if you claim to be a  rationalist,  an  empiricist,  or even someone who follows  science  and is otherwise a  non-believer,  then you will find yourself  unmoored from any first principles  necessary for even a pretense  of objective truth. Non-belief in otherwise \"unseen\" reality   doesn't negate the existence of that reality. You don't live in a mechanistic universe. You don't live in absurdist universe. And you certainly don't live in a   postmodern  universe.</p> <p>The postmodern \"deconstructions\" of  modern views  may yield absurdity,  but they are apt critiques. There is indeed a patriarchal hierarchy  which is the foundation for any and all  truth claims. The patriarchy is real! And it's not man-made. On some level the postmodernists  know this, and still reject it  (and hence reject truth itself).</p> <p>My truth, your truth </p> <p>For truth to have any meaning,  then truth must transcend all subjective  perspectives. Something is true if it is objectively true,  and knowledge of this objectivity  is what brings people to the \"Truth\".</p>"},{"location":"truth/#attributes-of-truth","title":"Attributes of Truth","text":"<p>Truth exists, and is knowable from the  source of truth.
