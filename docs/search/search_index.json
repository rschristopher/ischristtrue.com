As such,  many young and curious seekers of truth  approach the  fundamental questions  of life and fully expect  to find answers amongst the  philosophers  and so-called  \"intellectuals\"  of our modern age. For surely they must have answers --  these are afterall the   most fundamental questions  one could ever ask.</p> <p>Unfortunately, what we  find amongst the learned  philosophers and professional  intellectuals  is a nihilistic  program of   dead ideas,  a history of the failures   to answer  any  of the fundamental questions --  and we're left with  rationalizations and word games,  as if to  desensitize honest seekers,  to soothe them into  accepting the inevitable nihilism  that follows from not answering  the fundamental questions of life.</p> <p>Find one of these so-called  experts and ask them yourself -- Can we know anything? What does it mean to know?</p> <p>They may tell you about  epistemology,  about \"justified true belief\",  about the   Gettier problem,  and you'll find yourself  reading the likes of  Hume,  Kant,  Nietzsche,   Hegel,   Wittgenstein,  and many others. Or perhaps the absurdists like  Camus.  Or  if you have the temprament for it,  postmodernists like  Foucault. And then after a lot of study,  all you'll know is that  the mere concept of  objective truth doesn't  actually exist, or at least  is not knowable -- except  we can't even know that,  because to claim such a thing is  itself an objective truth claim.</p> <p>We now know less than we did  before we started. We could pretend everything is  rational and call ourselves  \"realists\" or  \"pragmatists\". And then like a pendulum   we could swing the other way and  embrace any of the esoteric  spiritual systems that are competing  for our attention;  transcendental  something-or-other. Maybe   Buddhists  have knowable objective truth. Or maybe one of the various  gurus  or   antigurus. Maybe we revert back to  secular liberalism, and find  ourselves yearning for the  comforts of ancient religious  beliefs that we just can't  bring ourselves to literally believe.</p> <p>For what is belief other than how  we act in the face of the  pain and suffering of life? What is it that we actually believe? And why do none of these  modern belief systems  offer any foundational answers  and always seem to bring us  further and further away  from those fundamental questions  we originally wanted to answer?</p> <p>The very nature of these questions presupposes that truth is not just facts about the way things are, but also meaning and morality about the way things should be. This is, afterall, the human condition. We ought to know something,  anything, about  our own existence.</p> <p>As the old Maori prayer goes,</p> <p>the light, the light ~ the seeking, the searching ~ in chaos, in chaos</p>"},{"location":"truth/#knowing-truth","title":"Knowing Truth","text":"<p>This should be a simple question,  is there objective knowable truth? Does truth exist?</p> <p>In the modern view,  there is no objective knowable truth. There are word games. There is a cascade of unconsciously   held beliefs behind every word,  even the word \"truth\". There is suffering. There is power and oppression. There is the deconstruction of  everything, even deconstructionism itself. Once again, we move further and further  away from the fundamental questions.</p> <p>If you are at all serious about pursuing  and knowing truth,  you may want to consider an alternative  to the fashionable trends of modern  philosophy which aims  away from fundamental questions,  as if on purpose. You may want to consider that the  entire enlightenment project  has yielded exactly this assault  on the fundamental questions,  and that it is specifically   anti-Christian in  its aim: from the secular humanists  with their watered down  Christian traditions,  to the pragmatists and devout  atheists, all the way to the esoteric  spiritual revivalism that springs  forth inevitably from the  spiritually dead atheists  and the spiritually weak humanists. All of these seemingly disparate worldviews  share a singular and notable feature:  to weaken and reject Christianity,  which just so happens to be the origin   of \"knowable objective truth\". For those who still hold a belief in  knowable objective truth and yet  reject Christianity, you are operating  on the fumes of a  dead Christian worldview,  and you'll find only absurdity at the  other end of your venture.</p> <p>But aha, you may be asking,  what about the ancient Romans  and their concept of a divine truth,  veritas? Or the stoics? Or the ancient Greek philosophers? Plato and Aristotle certainly had a lot to say on this matter. Christianity might have copied   the concept of an objective  knowable truth, but they did  not invent it, right? Except that veritas was a  pagan Goddess, daughter of Saturn,  in some tellings she was a creation  of Prometheus --  not exactly what we mean when  talking about truth. The stoics referred to the  anima mundi and a divine logos that brought the universe into being. And Plato referred to a  demiurge and platonic forms  which hardly bear a resemblance to  what we mean when talking  about objective knowable truth. Aristotle recognized that a first principle of logos is necessarily unexplainable (for if a first principle had a causal explanation than that cause would be the first principle). Ultimately, these concepts, especially of logos as first principle synthesized with equivalent Hebrew thought, and formed the basis of Christianity and what we mean today by   objective knowable truth.</p> <p>To be clear, if you claim to be a  rationalist,  an  empiricist,  someone who follows  science  and does not believe in  anything you can't  see with your own eyes,  then you will find yourself  unmoored from any first principles  necessary for even a pretense  of objective truth, and you've  probably numbed yourself to those  fundamental questions, and perhaps   stopped asking. You can ignore the fundamental questions,  but non-belief in an otherwise \"unseen\" reality   doesn't negate the existence of that reality. You don't live in a mechanistic universe,  because fundamental questions are  not mechanistic and yet still exist  and are still fundamental. You don't live in an absurdist universe --  accepting absurdism is to  abandon reason and will. And you certainly don't live in a   postmodernist  universe.</p> <p>The postmodern \"deconstructions\" of  modern views  will yield absurdity,  but they are still apt critiques  of the prideful rationalism we see in  secular culture. There does indeed appear to be a patriarchal hierarchy  which is the foundation for any and all  objective truth claims. It indeed can't be otherwise. The patriarchy, perhaps, is real! And yet it doesn't seem to be man-made, in fact it's the fabric of reality. It's everywhere the empiricists look. On some level the postmodernists  know this, and still reject it  (and hence reject truth itself).</p> <p>They'll say, \"my truth\", \"your truth\",  because truth to them is relative,  a language game of power. Yet we can't say this without making yet  another objective truth claim. Hypocrisy would bother them if they  believed in objective truth. But really, they are assaulting the very  idea of knowable objective truth,  reducing it to self worship.</p> <p>For truth to have any meaning,  then truth must transcend all subjective  perspectives. Something is true if it is objectively true,  and knowledge of this objectivity  is what brings people to \"the Truth\".</p> <p>Modern views  frame  truth as an attribute,  that something is either true or it is not. But in practice,  truth is experienced in very personal ways,  and not at all confined to sense perceptions. We once understood this in our culture,  that truth is revealed to you personally.</p> <p>Ancient views  understood truth as a spirit,  which means Truth was  something akin to a person. If there is a spirit of truth,  then we should not ask,  \"what is true?\"  we ought to ask  \"who is truth?\" In fact, as we shall see,  this is the only way  we can even hope to arrive  at knowable objective truth.</p>"},{"location":"truth/#spirit-of-truth","title":"Spirit of Truth","text":"<p>The spirit of truth,  like any spirit,  can be thought of as a  pattern of reality.

It might make demands of us;  we might participate in or  be mere components of the  these spirits. Understood properly, we can see spirits  everywhere, in all manner of systems   that we interact with and participate in. Anyone can \"see\" spirits, if not directly  through symbolism or iconography,  but through patterns of reality  over time.</p> <p>If you haven't thought of a spirit  in this way, and instead  think of spirits as  translucent ghosts that don't   interact with our world but hover  about --  this is most certainly not a spirit,  this is a childish caricature  and it demonstrates the unquestioned  nihilism that possesses our modern sensibilities.

E.g., even the leaf turning to face the sun; the functionality is obvious, the leaf is absorbing as much sunlight as possible. But what is the meaning and morality of a leaf turning to face the sun? The meaning is to use the sun's energy to convert water into energy for the tree. The morality is that the tree is good when it does this, it flourishes with sun, and dies otherwise. And most fascinating, if you perceive one aspect of a truth claim, such as a moral intuition, you can then grasp the other attributes, including meaning. Apply this to life itself, and examine the moral intuitions of what it means to live in a way that is good, and you'll simultaneously arrive at the meaning of life.</p> <p>In our modern reductionist worldview, we often blind ourselves to revealed truths, even while our attention is captivated by, say, the beauty of a sunset, we'll fail to see the meaning.

Seeking truth is to orient your entire  life into a relationship  with the Spirit of Truth,  with God,  revealing meaning  sufficient to endure the suffering  of this world.</p> <p>Importantly, by denying objective morality and beauty -- denying that morality and beauty are objectively knowable -- you will be left with the inversion of beauty and morality, which is fashion and relativism.

That is, the Spirit of Truth is  the creator of the universe,  who was incarnate as man,  who was crucified for us,  and on the third day He  rose again. To be clear, there is no justifiable   epistemology outside of Christianity  and these seemingly outrageous claims. There have been   countless attempts,  but all lead to nihilism,  to a rejection of knowable truth. Rejecting the uniquely Christian notion  of knowable truth yields only  a desperate yearning for  nothingness  (to return to nothingness).</p> <p>And even more outrageous,  Christ is the mediator between  God and man, between God the Father   and man -- and thus between  God's will and man.

Beauty draws you to Him, revealing His design, beckoning you to return to a state of grace. To believe in objective  knowable truth is to   necessarily also believe that your soul is eternal.

On what happens to our immortal soul  after death.</p> <p>There is a longing by nihilists  -- from  the humanists who don't consider  themselves nihilists, to the  realists who scoff at the very idea --  that after death is nothingness. They don't just believe this,   they yearn for this. And note when they say,  \"I'll return back to where I was  before I was born\". They believe they came from a  great nothingness,  that their entire being  was created from nothingness  -- and they wonder why the  astute theists will point out  that they unconsciously believe in God  (for who else creates ex nihilo?)</p> <p>Is this really the end fate  of a human soul?  To return to nothingness? Of course they yearn for this,  because any serious thinker  will feel in their soul  a terrible fear, a fear of immortality,  a fear of God.</p> <p>The naive half-educated \"intellectuals\"  of our time imagine immortality  as just the  fantasy of \"less evolved\"  superstitious Christians. That they are more evolved and accept  the truth of their nothingness. But this, as we will see, is itself  a feel-good fantasy. Note these same \"intellectuals\"  will take seriously   trans-hunanist  arguments  and want to \"upload\" their consciousness  into a machine.</p> <p>Truth is, Christians fear immortality,  because they fear God -- they fear  the judgment that is due. Because they know, deep down, that they  are unworthy of His grace. And that only through the intercession  of Christ will they receive salvation.</p> <p>As much as some pious half-hearted  Christians imagine themselves as already  saved, deep down they know,  that it was us  who crucified the Son of God. The creator of the universe became man,  and we killed him. And let's be clear, the creator of  the universe didn't just appear as   a symbol, but became man --  the totality of God fit within  a single human being. For we were created in the image  and likeness of God.</p> <p>A single human life is worth more to God  than the entire cosmos. The essence of God cannot be contained  in all of the stars in existence,  let alone the person of God. And yet, there He was. The creator of all, born in a manger.</p> <p>The human soul is immortal, and even after the fall, we retain an immortal soul. We once beheld the face of God,  and we shone with His radiance,  with no shame or vulnerability in  our being. It is after the fall, turning away  from God, did we see our material  bodily nature, our vulnerability,  our nakedness. And in our sin of pride, of wanting  to be as God,  was death set upon creation.</p> <p>And so, what happens to such exalted  creatures, made in the image and likeness  of God, when we die? Nothingness? This is the longing of the atheist -- because the alternative is too frightful to bear. For if God is real, then man's soul   is immortal,  and by not accepting salvation,  salvation  which is freely given, how will  such a soul respond to eternity  without God to sustain them? They will seek the cold nothingness,  for the alternative is the light of  God, who they were made to glorify. Such light would be unbearable. They exist in meaningless darkness,  seeking for nothingness, turning  away from God whose light  burns their sin, their pride, yet they  hold and cling to pride,  to their resentment of God,  for their desire is for God  to erase their created soul as a mistake,  which in their pride is what they would do. God's love is here, ready to  save, and yet they still refuse, forever,  burning in pain while desperate for  the abyss of nothingness. This is hell.</p> <p>If you want to understand hell,  understand the value of your life,  the value of a single human life. Recognize the divinity of the lowliest  of human lives. Remember that our souls are immortal,  and that we  (created in the image and likeness of the creator of the universe)  will not return to nothingness. A human soul is not destined for nirvana nor moksha --  every soul is destined for truth, be it glorious, be it cold, be it fire.</p> <p>God have mercy on us.</p>"},{"location":"doctrines/justification/","title":"Justification","text":"<p>https://classicalchristianity.com/2011/02/25/on-limited-atonement/ St. Gregory of Nyssa ca. 335-394</p> <p>\u201cBut why is it,\u201d they ask, \u201cthat all men do not obtain the grace, but that, while some adhere to the Word, the portion who remain unbelieving is no small one; either because God was unwilling to bestow his benefit ungrudgingly upon all, or because He was altogether unable to do so?\u201d Now neither of these alternatives can defy criticism.

But if the call came with equal meaning to all and makes no distinction as to worth, age, or different national characteristics (for it was for this reason that at the very first beginning of the proclamation of the Gospel they who ministered the Word were, by Divine inspiration, all at once enabled to speak in the language of any nation, viz. in order that no one might be destitute of a share in the blessings of evangelical instruction), with what reasonableness can they still charge it upon God that the Word has not influenced all mankind? </p> <p>https://orthodoxchristiantheology.com/2020/12/11/the-orthodox-doctrine-of-justification-the-biblical-teaching/</p> <p>https://orthodoxchristiantheology.com/2020/12/17/the-orthodox-doctrine-of-justification-the-patristic-and-conciliar-teaching</p> <p>Romans 8:30 also see commentary from Symeon the New Theologian:</p> <p>Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. - Romans 8:30</p> <p>It is not God\u2019s foreknowledge of those who, by their free choice and zeal, will prevail which is the cause of their victory, just as, again, it is not His knowing beforehand who will fall and be vanquished which is responsible for their defeat.

While He says, \u201cI came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance\u201d [Matthew 9:13], you, lazy and unwilling to turn around and repent of your evil, contradict Him, as it were, and call Him a liar Who never lies, when you make such excuses as these. \u201cThose who are going to repent\u201d, you say, \u201cwere predestined, but I am not one of them.

Why do you reason to your own perdition rather than your salvation? And why do you pick out for yourselves the obscure passages of inspired Scripture and then tear them out of context and twist them in order to accomplish your own destruction? Do you not hear the Savior crying out every day: \u201cAs I live \u2026 I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live\u201d [Ezekiel 33:11]?

Did He ever say to some: \u201cDo not repent for I will not accept you,\u201d while to others who were predestined: \u201cBut you, repent! because I knew you beforehand\u201d? Of course not! Instead, throughout the world and in every church He shouts: \u201cCome to Me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\u201d [Matthew 11:28]. Come, He says, all you who are burdened with many sins, to the One Who takes away the sin of the world; come all who thirst to the fountain which flows and never dies.</p> <p>Does He distinguish and separate anyone out, calling one to Himself as foreknown while sending the other away as not predestined?

For even if someone is a publican, or a fornicator, an adulterer, a murderer, or whatever else, the Master does not turn him away, but takes away the burden of his sins immediately and makes him free. And how does He take away the other\u2019s burden? Just as He once took away that of the paralytic when He said to the latter: \u201cMy son, your sins are forgiven\u201d [Matthew 9:2], and the man was immediately relieved of his burden and, in addition, received the cure of his body.</p> <p>So then, let everyone who wants approach Him, and let the one say: \u201cSon of David, have mercy on me\u201c; and, if he hears, \u201cWhat do you want Me to do for you?\u201d let him say quickly, \u201cLord, let me receive my sight,\u201d and right away he will hear, \u201cSo I desire.

If someone is hesitant and does not wish to approach the Master, even if He comes to him and says, \u201cFollow Me\u201d [Matthew 9:9], then let him follow Him as the publican once did, abandoning his counting tables and his avarice, and, I am sure, He shall make of him, too, an evangelist rather than a tax collector. If someone else is a paralytic, lying for years in sloth, carelessness, and love of pleasure, and if he should see another, be it the Master Himself or one of His disciples, come to him and ask, \u201cDo you want to be healed?\u201d [John 5:2-7], let him receive the word joyfully and reply immediately: \u201cYes, Lord, but I have no man to put me into the pool of repentance.\u201d And then if he should hear, \u201cRise, take up your bed, and follow me,\u201d let him get up right away and run after the footsteps of the One Who has called him from on high.</p> <p>Now, if someone does not wish, whether like the sinful woman to embrace the feet of Christ [Luke 7:38], or like the prodigal son to run back to Him with burning repentance [Luke 15:11ff], or like the woman with a hemorrhage and bowed with infirmity [Luke 8:43 and 13:11] even to approach Him, why does he then make excuses for his sins by saying, \u201cThose whom He foreknew, them also\u201c\u2013and them alone!\u2013\u201cHe called\u201c?</p> <p>One may perhaps reasonably reply to the person so disposed that \u201cGod, Who is before eternity and Who knows all things before creating them, also knew you beforehand, knew that you would not obey Him when He called, that you would not believe in His promises and in His words, yet still, even while knowing this, He \u201cbowed the heavens and came down\u201d [Psalm 18:19] and became man, and for your sake has come to the place where you lie prone. Indeed, visiting you many times every day, sometimes in His own Person and sometimes as well through His servants, He exhorts you to get up from the calamity in which you lie and to follow Him Who ascends to the Kingdom of Heaven and enter it together with Him. But you, you still refuse to do it.</p> <p>Then tell me, who is responsible for your perdition and disobedience? You, who refuse to obey and who will not follow your Master, or God Himself Who made you, Who knew beforehand that you would not obey Him, but would instead abide in your hardened and impenitent heart? I think that you will certainly say, \u201cHe is not responsible, but I am myself,\u201d because God\u2019s forbearance is not the cause of our hardness, Rather, it is our own lack of compliance.</p> <p>For God knows all things beforehand, both past and present at once, and everything which is going to happen in the future up to the end of the world. He sees them as already present, because in and through Him all things hold together [Colossians 1:17]. Indeed, just as today the emperor takes in with a glance those who race and who wrestle in the area, but does not thereby make himself responsible for the victory of the winners or the failure of the losers\u2013the zeal, or in other cases the slackness, of the contestants being cause of their victory or defeat\u2013understand with me that it is just so with God Himself. When He endowed us with free will, giving commandments to teach us instead how we must oppose our adversaries, He left it to the free choice of each either to oppose and vanquish the enemy, or to relax and be miserably defeated by him. Nor does He leave us entirely to ourselves\u2013for He knows the weakness of human nature\u2013but rather is present Himself with us and, indeed, allies Himself with those who choose to struggle, and mysteriously imbues us with strength, and Himself, not we, accomplishes the victory over the adversary. This the earthly emperor is unable to do, since he is himself also a man, and is rather in need himself of assistance, just as we require it, too.</p> <p>God, on the other hand, Who is mighty and invincible, becomes, as we just said, an ally of those who willingly choose to do battle with the enemy, and He establishes them as victors over the cunning of the devil. He does not, however, compel any who do not so choose to this war, in order that He not destroy the power of choice which is proper to our reasoning nature, made according to His own image, and bring us down to the level of unreasoning brutes. Thus God, as we have explained, sees us all at once as if in an arena, just like the earthly emperor looks down on the athletes in competition. But, while the latter does not know who will lose and who will win until he sees the outcome of their contest and, though he may prepare the victors\u2019 crowns beforehand, he still does not know to whom he is going to present them; the King of Heaven, on the other hand, knows from before the ages exactly who the victors and vanquished are going to be. This is why He said to those who asked Him if they could sit at His right hand and His left in His glory: \u201cIt is not mine to give to you\u201d [Matthew 20:23], but that it will be given instead to those for whom it was prepared.</p> <p>This therefore what Paul himself also knew when he said rightly:</p> <p>Those whom God foreknew, the same He also predestined; and those whom He predestined, He also called; and those whom He called, the same He also glorified. [Romans 8:29-30]</p> <p>It is not God\u2019s foreknowledge of those who, by their free choice and zeal, will prevail which is the cause of their victory, just as, again, it is not His knowing beforehand who will fall and be vanquished which is responsible for their defeat. Instead, it is the zeal, deliberate choice, and courage of each of us which effects the victory. Our faithlessness and sloth, our irresolution and indolence, on the other hand, comprise our defeat and perdition. So, while reclining on our bed of worldly affection and love of pleasure, let us not say: \u201cThose whom God fore-knew, them also He predestined,\u201d without perceiving just what it is we are saying. Yes, indeed, He truly knew you beforehand as inattentive and disobedient and lazy, but this is certainly not because He ordered or foreordained it that you should have no power to repent yourself nor, if you will it, to get up and obey. You, though, when you say this, are clearly calling God a liar. While He says, \u201cI came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance\u201d [Matthew 9:13], you, lazy and unwilling to turn around and repent of your evil, contradict Him, as it were, and call Him a liar Who never lies, when you make such excuses as these. \u201cThose who are going to repent\u201d, you say, \u201cwere predestined, but I am not one of them. So, let them repent therefore whom God clearly foreknew, and whom He also predestined.\u201d O what a lack of feeling! O shamelessness of soul and worse than the demons themselves! When did anyone ever hear of one of them saying such a thing? Where was it ever heard that a demon blamed God for its own damnation? Let us then not blame the demons, for here there is a human soul which thinks up blasphemies even worse than theirs.</p> <p>So tell me, where did you learn that you did not belong to those who are foreknown and predestined to become conformed to the image of God\u2019s glory? Tell me, who told you this? Was it, maybe, God Who announced this to you, Himself, or by one of His prophets, or through an angel? \u201cNo,\u201d you say, \u201cbut I do suppose that I am not predestined to salvation, and that all my effort would be in vain.\u201d And why do you not believe instead with all your soul that God has sent His only-begotten Son on the earth for your sake alone, and for your salvation, that He knew you beforehand and predestined you to become His brother and co-heir? Why are you not eager to love Him with all your heart and to honor His saving commandments? Why do you not rather believe that, having been slaughtered for your sake, He will never abandon you, nor allow you to perish? Do you not hear Him saying: \u201cCan a woman forget her suckling child . . . yet I will not forget you\u201d [Isaiah 49:15]? So, if by anticipation you judge yourself unworthy, and willfully separate yourself from the flock of Christ\u2019s sheep, you should understand that it is none other than you who are the cause of your own damnation.</p> <p>Therefore, casting out of our souls all faithlessness, sloth, and hesitation, let us draw near with all our heart, with unhesitating faith and burning desire, like slaves who have been newly purchased with precious blood. Indeed, with reverence for the price paid on our behalf, and with love for our Master Who paid it, and as having accepted His love for us, let us recognize that, if He had not wished to save by means of Himself us who have been purchased, He would not have come down to earth, nor would He have been slain for our sake. But, as it is written, He has done this because He wills that all should be saved. Listen to Him say it Himself: \u201cI did not come to judge the world, but to save the world\u201d [John 12:17]. - \"Second Ethical Discourse\"</p> <ul> <li>Symeon the New Theologian</li> </ul> <p>Read more commentaries at https://catenabible.com/com/60284b9f365356511a1132fa</p>"},{"location":"doctrines/mediator/","title":"Christ as the Mediator","text":"<p>For there is one God and one Mediator  between God and men,  the Man Christ Jesus,  (1 Tim. 2:5)</p> <p>https://blogs.ancientfaith.com/glory2godforallthings/2020/02/15/the-one-mediator-and-the-sacraments/</p> <p>Christ mediates between us and  God the Father.

And yet Dostoyevsky manages it beautifully, and prior to Nietzsche.</p> <p>In The Possessed by Dostoyevsky, written in 1872, the character Krillov says,</p> <p>Everything will be new...  then they will divide history into two parts:  from the gorilla to the   annihilation of God,  and from the annihilation of God  to the transformation of the earth,  and of man physically.</p> <p>Very clearly, we can trace the origin of the modern view back to the late 1800s, to the prescience of Dostoyevsky in the east and Nietzsche in the west.</p> <p>In a frightfully prophetic view, Nietzsche (in Will to Power) writes,</p> <p>What I am describing here is the history of the twentieth century, the triumph of Nihilism, because when the masses get the ideas which I am now proclaiming, there will be a revolution such as the world has never seen.</p> <p>And in The Gay Science he writes,</p> <p>Shall we not ourselves have to become gods merely to seem worthy of it (the death of God)?</p> <p>And in Thus Spake Zarathustra,</p> <p>I bring you a goal; I preach to you the Superman.

Seraphim Rose).</p> <p>And even earlier than Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky, we find other prophetic voices such as Heinrich Heine.

We see this same destructive revolutionary view in the early scholastic period, articulated through  millenarianism  that grew especially popular in that era.</p> <p>For example the  Joachimites in the 13th century imagined three ages (based on the trinity: Father, Son, Holy Spirit), and that they were entering the 3rd and final age. Joachim believed that the end of the Christian era would be in the year 1260, which would see the coming of the Antichrist, followed by a thousand year utopia (the age defined by the Holy Spirit). These views were (perhaps unconsciously) reflected in Nazism, that the 3rd Reich will rule for a thousand years.</p> <p>As Fr. Seraphim Rose notes,</p> <p>revolutionary conclusions were drawn later by men of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, by the Franciscan Spirituals, who recognized in Joachim the new John the Baptist, heralding St. Francis at the novus dux of the last dispensation, even as the \"new Christ\".</p> <p>Any such view of a \"new Christ\" was anathema to orthodox Christianity, yet this corruption in western Christianity was one of many that led inevitably to the Protestant Reformation, itself another outburst of the destructive revolutionary spirit.

Yet even within the subtle nuances of  the Greek word   synergoi  the core debate rages on. And if we detour back to our  pre-Christian history, this exact   question of free will and  predestination is what  divided the  Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes.</p> <p>One of the earliest Christian free will  debates was the  Pelagian Controversy. In this historic debate  St. Pelagius wrote against the predestination views of  St. Augustine, and these objections later became known as  Pelagianism. The Pelagians reacted to the perceived lack  of free will within  St. Augustine's writings --  this reaction introduced anti-Biblical views  (that original sin did not taint human nature). And all of this was an effort to allow for human free will. The Pelagian view  was deemed heretical   (see Canon V from the Council of 418). However, the debate continued afterwards in a reactionary cycle producing various  semi-Pelagian views.</p> <p>Semi-Pelegianism</p> <p>Broadly speaking, a semi-Pelegian view is any that grants humans some ability for salvation independent of God's grace. Even in the most rationalistic terms, if the Pelagian view was 100% man choosing to be good, the semi-Pelegian view is anything greater than 0% </p> <p>E.g., if one is to say that man possesses some small ability to do good and reach salvation independent of God, just 0.1% man and 99.9% is God, then this a semi-Pelegian view. </p> <p>The contrary view is not necessarily 0% for man (although that view exists), but rather an insistence that 100% of goodness and salvation is due to God.</p> <p>From these ongoing debates over free will,  synergism  became the agreed upon solution by orthodox Christians. This view was reinforced in the  fourth ecumenical council  determining that the person of Christ  has both a human and divine will,  that Christ is both God and man --  a view that was further reinforced in the  sixth ecumenical council. As time went on, this orthodox view of synergism   has occasionally drifted, often times  with deliberate misrepresentations  into semi-Pelagian views,  resulting in renewed debates  that parallel those from early church history.</p> <p>For example,  the protestant debates around   sola fide  or the Calvinist debates around  Arminianism vs Monergism,   these mimic the centuries old Pelagian debates,  including nuanced in-between views such as  Molinism.</p>"},{"location":"modern-views/free-will/#arminianism-and-monergism","title":"Arminianism and Monergism","text":"<p>As if to parallel the early Pelagian controversy,  Arminianism arose as a reaction to the writings of   John Calvin  who was heavily influenced by   the writings of St. Augustine   on predestination. The Arminian reaction was especially concerned with Calvin's views of  reprobation  (or what is otherwise known as    double predestination),  which is a logical conclusion to the denial of human free will,  that the non-elect were effectively chosen for damnation  (that God \"adjudges others to eternal death\").</p> <p>These strict Calvinist views are known as  monergism. The antithetical reaction to monergism came from the writings of  Jacobus Arminius  whose views led (inevitably) to a schism  within the Calvinist churches, such that the  Remonstrant Brotherhood  split from the Dutch Reformed Church. The Remonstrant Arminian view was explicitly condemned   at the   Synod of Dort  which is what led to the articulation of the  five points of Calvinism  (known by the mnemonic acronym TULIP).</p> <p>And exactly like the emergence of semi-Pelagianism, the condemnation  of Remonstrant Arminianism  led inevitably to a rationalistic Arminianism. Many of these views are  superficially similar to the Roman Catholic view of synergism (that man retains some ability to do good independent of God's grace, specifically to freely choose to accept grace). What followed in the century after Dort was a  migration away from strict monergism but not  stopping at rational Arminianism, instead leading inevitably towards  deism,  itself a stepping stone into the postmodern  malaise and meaning crisis. As a result, and as astute Calvinists have maintained,  any view that takes away from the complete  sovereignty of God (and irresistable grace) inevitably leads to   deism, naturalism, and ultimately to what  Nietzsche  described as the death of God  in the hearts of man.</p> <p>Arminianism is semi-Pelegian</p> <p>In rationalistic terms, the Arminian view grants to man a small ability to choose good (a step towards salvation) that is independent of God. Even if we say this is only 0.01% man and 99.99% God, this is semi-Pelegian by definition.</p> <p>Importantly this view emerges inevitably as a reaction to the strict monergistic doctrine of reprobation. In rationalistic terms, monergism insists that God is 100% responsible for man's salvation, but reprobation is to say God is 100% responsible for man's condemnation. Thus man's will is not sufficient to participate in his own salvation, because all was predetermined.</p> <p>The orthodox view of synergism is to say God is 100% responsible for man's salvation while conversely man is 100% responsible for his own condemnation. And thus man willfully participates in his own salvation.</p> <p>Slippery slopes aside,  while we can easily dispense with the semi-Pelagian  views of Arminianism,  if we are truly concerned with truth,  then we are left with an ongoing  debate between   strict monergism  and  orthodox synergism. It seems as if  either John Calvin and the reformers were wrong,  or John Chrysostom and all of the church fathers were wrong.

From Pelagianism to Arminianism to the various councils/synods  condeming them -- the pattern is as timeless as Christianity itself. Importantly, this confirms the  observation that Arminianism is  contained with Calvinism. These are clearly two sides of the same coin. The five points of Calvinism contain within their strict dogma  a seed of semi-Pelagianism, be it Arminianism or Molinism or  whatever the -ism.</p> <p>This is necessarily true because the five points of Calvinism (TULIP) are true from a transcendent level of analysis, and not the particular level of human  behavior. Rationality itself is contingent upon this transcendent level of analysis, and while we can make sense of TULIP through transcendent categories, we cannot apply it to particulars, say, to your own prayer life (other than as a reminder of God's absolute sovereignty, which is also affirmed in orthodox synergism).</p> <p>This is in fact what it means for Christ to be the mediator between the high and the low, between fallen man and God the father -- because He is unifying the particular (man's will) with the transcendent (divine will).</p> <p>Resolving this ongoing reactionary cycle requires Christ. The revealed truth of Christ with His divine will and human will, is the unification of the truths of monergism (e.g., of irresistable grace) acted out in the truths of synergism. Traditionally this is what is meant by orthodox synergism.</p>"},{"location":"modern-views/free-will/#orthodox-view","title":"Orthodox View","text":"<p>The Biblical narrative is very clear  on two points:</p> <p>1 - God has ultimate sovereignty, and</p> <p>2 - man has free will.</p> <p>The structure of the Biblical narrative  affirms both points. God is a character in the  Bible, as is man,  who was created in the image  and likeness of God. This is not an impersonal God of deism. God is not only personal, but our very  notion of personhood is from God,  that is, we possess personhood because  we ware made in the image and likeness of God. Our free will exists in that we  participate in His will. And His will is done.  He is the transcendent source of all creation. Even God hardening (strengthening)  Pharoah's heart,   this is what allowed Pharoah  to follow his own free will into   certain destruction.</p> <p>These two revealed truths, of God's sovereignty and man's free will, create a potential dilemma, as effectively both sides of the free will debate are strongly affirmed in the Bible. And thus any interpretation of scripture which denies one side can be declared false. And the question of reconciling these seemingly contrary views is left as a divine mystery, one that parallels the life and character of Jesus Christ.</p> <p>This in effect is affirmed in the Chalcedonian Definition  (from the  fourth ecumenical council) that Christ has two wills and that Christ is both God and man. This necessarily implies that man's free  will not only exists but that it  can be redeemed in Christ. Note also how the human will of Christ  not only was tempted by Satan, but also  participates in the will of the father,  with perfect obedience so as to glorify God (the father). Christ's human will participated harmoniously with His divine will, and did so in a way that makes it possible for us to participate harmoniously with His divine sovereign will. By coming to Christ we find in Christ  an answer to the free will  question;  and we find affirmation that any interpretation  that denies or compromises free will or that denies or compromises God's ultimate sovereignty, any such compromised views are as heretical and false as denying that Christ is both God and man.</p> <p>Only by affirming that Christ is both God and man, such that man is both free and completely subject to God's sovereignty, can we make sense of the Bible. This is what is traditionally known as  synergism  from the Greek synergoi, as Saint Paul writes,</p> <p>1 Corinthians 3:9</p> <p>\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b3\u03ac\u03c1 \u1f10\u03c3\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03af\u00b7 \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b3\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5.</p> <p>Theou gar esmen synergoi; Theou ge\u00f4rgion, Theou oecodom\u00ea este.</p> <p>For we are fellow workers with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.</p> <p>Orthodox synergism is notably different from Roman Catholic synergism as well as rational Arminian synergism, in that the orthodox view affirms God's absolute sovereignty through Christ's divine will, while simultaneously affirming man's free will through Christ's human will. This does not compromise on irresistible grace nor total depravity, nor any of the five points of Calvinism (though it does disagree with reprobation). In fact, it becomes clear that Calvinism speaks of Christ's divine will while making no claims about Christ's human will and the necessary implications to man's free will. Or rather, this is why Calvinists find reprobation (double predestination) so controversial.</p> <p>Ultimately, the creator of the universe became flesh, became man -- the divine Logos incarnate. And as such lived with sinless perfection, participating in the divine will through His human will.</p> <p>While orthodox synergism has often been maligned and misrepresented  (conflated with Roman Catholic synergism or Arminian semi-Pelagian heresies),  the core doctrine of orthodox synergy remains crucial  and necessary to the truth of the Biblical narrative.</p> <p>In fact, there were attempts at reconciliation between the early reformed church  and the Eastern Orthodox church. Unfortunately this did not lead to unification,  although it did bear good fruits in what is known as  The Confession of Dositheus  which better articulated the Eastern Orthodox positions  with respect to reformed theology more generally.

That is, the rules of mathematics limit the supply of Bitcoin.</p> <p>Work is God-given and pure, existing before the fall. Proof of work for transaction settlement is a harder money than gold in every possible sense. The incentives for mining will be in part due to the desire for transaction settlement itself. Financial sovereigns will mine not just for profit, the margins will be too slim over time, but they will mine so that they can guarantee that their transactions can be settled and not whitelisted.</p> <p>Gold does not provide proof of work for transaction settlement (including securing gold), hence the hidden cost of settlement is born out in physical security of transferring gold. Bitcoin includes proof of work for transaction settlement, and in fact this is incorporated into issuance (money production). The same work backs both. Should these have been separate? Would a separate proof of work for transaction settlement be beneficial? Or is it necessary to include them together?  By including them together, it provides the minimum proof of work necessary for the monetary system to sustain.</p>"},{"location":"modern-views/morality/","title":"Morality","text":"<p>Let's examine the nature of good and evil, of progress, or even just the word better.

Or as the snake in the garden promised,</p> <p>ye shall be as gods</p> <p>And while there may not be a philosophical problem of evil, the modern view most certainly has a philosophical problem of good. That is, why is there good? Why is there light and not complete darkness? To answer this question is also to answer the nature of evil.</p> <p>We exist with an intuitive sense of good and evil, objectively knowable good and evil. Modern views must explain why there is good. Why there is a \"better\" or a \"progress\" anywhere in our vocabulary. What is our aim in life without a universal and objectively knowable good? Even Nietzsche, as brilliant as he was, completely missed this point (what makes the Ubermensch better, and with what criteria do we define \"better\"?)</p> <p>Truth is, only the modern rationalistic views have this philosophical problem, for they cannot explain goodness, let alone evil. They project this onto Christianity as a nihilistic attack. And winsome milquetoast Christians fall for this false framing, implicitly agreeing with an anti-Christian view of their own faith, imagining that they have to answer this philosophical riddle through various theodicies, as if the burden of proof is on the Christian, rather than on the modern view to first explain \"good\" as something objectively knowable in their worldview.</p> <p>If there is no objectively knowable good and evil, e.g., if it's all relativistic, then there's no philosophical problem because there's no such thing as good and evil.
