There is word games. There is suffering. There is power and oppression. There is the deconstruction of  everything, even deconstructionism itself.</p> <p>To be clear, if you claim to be a  rationalist,  an  empiricist,  someone who follows  science  and does not believe in  spirits or anything you can't  see with your own eyes,  then you will find yourself  unmoored from any first principles  necessary for even a pretense  of objective truth. Non-belief in an otherwise \"unseen\" reality   doesn't negate the existence of that reality. You don't live in a mechanistic universe. You don't live in absurdist universe. And you certainly don't live in a   postmodern  universe.</p> <p>The postmodern \"deconstructions\" of  modern views  may yield absurdity,  but they are apt critiques  of the rationalism we see in  secular culture. There is indeed a patriarchal hierarchy  which is the foundation for any and all  truth claims. The patriarchy is real! And yet it's not man-made. On some level the postmodernists  know this, and still reject it  (and hence reject truth itself).</p> <p>My truth, your truth ...</p> <p>For truth to have any meaning,  then truth must transcend all subjective  perspectives. Something is true if it is objectively true,  and knowledge of this objectivity  is what brings people to \"the Truth\".</p> <p>Modern views understand truth as an attribute,  that something is either true or it is not. But in practice,  truth is experienced in very personal ways,  and not at all confined to sense perceptions.</p> <p>Ancient Views  understood truth as a spirit,  which means it has personhood,  as all spirits do. If there is a spirit of truth,  then we should not ask,  \"what is true?\"  we ought to ask  \"who is truth?\"</p>"},{"location":"truth/#spirit-of-truth","title":"Spirit of Truth","text":"<p>Truth, or the spirit of truth,  like any spirit,  can be thought of as a  pattern of reality. A pattern of reality that is  objectively real (and not  a veil of delusions  or perceptions). In other words, that which  is objectively real is  the spirit we are referring. And rather than a what,  this is better understood as a who.</p> <p>A spirit is any pattern of reality with   a non-material consciousness,  which is all consciousness. It has agency and   self awareness. It has personal attributes.</p> <p>If you haven't thought of a spirit  in this way, and instead  think of spirits as  translucent ghosts that don't   interact with our world but hover  about --  this is most certainly not a spirit,  this is a childish caricature. Anyone can \"see\" a spirit, if not directly  through symbolism or iconography,  then through patterns of reality  over time. A spirit is just that, a pattern of  reality that has conscious agency.</p> <p>Think of the spirit of a city. A city over time will grow and  move about like an amoeba  (though we rarely think of it this way). In a secular worldview we might refer  to the \"emergent\" patterns and behavior  of such a complex system. But the word \"emergence\" is what if  not consciousness? Such an entity reacts to the outside  world beyond its \"body\",  with sense organs and means  with which to actualize its will. It might make demands of us, we might  be mere components in this   \"emergent\" consciousness --  the same way the bacteria in your  gut are an integral part of the  emergent consciousness that is known  as \"you\".</p> <p>In this way we can see spirits  everywhere, in all manner of complex systems   that we interact with and participate in. These are patterns of reality over time,  they  are not normally visible because through  our biased thinking we rarely see  the consciousness of anything other  than ourselves and other human beings  (if even that). But everywhere in nature, in our own  interactions and what we observe around us,  this \"emergence\" of consciousness is everywhere.</p> <p>Spirits everywhere, even in the most simple  systems, such as a leaf turning to face  the sun. In our secular mechanistic presuppositions  we imagine this as purely \"natural causes\",  as if that explained anything.</p> <p>We often play word games with what are  objectively spirits making themselves  known to us. Spirits have implicit meaning, beauty,  and functions  that transcend the limits  of a mechanistic worldview. Those trapped in a   mechanistic worldview are blind to  the everpresent spirits in front of their  own face, pretending with  absurd pride that humans are the originators  of all the beauty and meaning  they perceive, that only the functions  of the natural world are real  (and some deny even that).</p> <p>But even so, even if only the causal functions  of these complex emergent patterns are  real, then is that itself not clear  evidence of spirits that anyone can see? If you look upon a thunderstorm do you see  the entirety of the storm all at once? No, it is a pattern over time, a spirit. And it is much like your own consciousness,  a pattern of reality over time. Your consciousness emerges from the  complex interactions from your   body and mind;  much like the thunderstorm emerges  from the complex interactions  of water vapor, pressure, and electricity.</p> <p>Who then is the Spirit of Truth?</p> <p>All things as they are,  all patterns, simple and complex,  all that was, is, and will be --  including our own bodies and minds --  this is the spirit of truth. What kind of being, what kind of spirit  could encompass all?</p> <p>Well, turns out there's only a handful of  possible answers. Either such a being exists, or doesn't. And if such a being does exist,  that spirit is either knowable, or not.</p> <p>This somewhat crude classification  can handily separate the multitude  of religious worldviews and metaphysical  paradigms into a useful filter, as ultimately  we are only concerned with the existence  of a divine spirit of truth  that is itself knowable.</p> <p>If the spirit of truth does not exist,  or is not knowable to us,  then gone too is any hope of any defensible  epistemology. In other words, we can't know anything and  there cannot be knowable truth about ourselves  or the universe without a spirit of truth  making knowledge available to us.</p> <p>Whoever this divine spirit of truth is,  this universal pattern of reality,  it is a being who grants us knowledge  of ourselves and the world we live in. Importantly, we are now  at the limits of logic  and reason. For logic and reason cannot contain  in themselves   that which gives rise to logic and reason. Logic and reason are not self sustaining,  they do not grant us knowledge of truth. They are but artifacts of our consciousness,  the means with which we make sense of the  world around us. The divine truth, this spirit of truth,  must be the source of logic and reason --  the means given to us to make sense  of the world.</p>"},{"location":"truth/#truth-is-revealed","title":"Truth is Revealed","text":"<p>As we cannot reach objective and knowable truth  through reason and logic,  then it must  be revealed (if there is truth). And this revelation of truth can only  happen through communion, that is,  relationship between ourselves and  the Spirit of Truth.</p> <p>What is our relationship to such a spirit?</p> <p>This we can only know by revelation. By asking.</p>"},{"location":"truth/#meaning-and-morality","title":"Meaning and Morality","text":"<p>Truth claims, as revealed to us,  contain not only the causal functions  that materialists misattribute to  \"natural causes\"  (saying something is \"natural\"  doesn't actually explain anything) --  truth claims also contain meaning  and morality, in other words, values  of what is good and what is not. This should not be surprising since  revelatory truth cane from a relationship  with a spirit that is the source of all  that is. Just as we share truth claims with  each other,  so too does the Spirit of Truth  share with us.</p> <p>What we understand as morality,  ethical behavior, how we ought to live,  is intractable from a truth claim. All truth claims consist of  causal functionality,  morality,   meaning,  and beauty.</p> <p>Seeking truth is then not an  idle hobby of bored philosophers. Seeking truth is to orient your entire  life into a relationship with God,  with the Spirit of Truth,  imbuing your life with meaning  sufficient to endure the suffering  of this world.</p> <p>https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth/</p> <p>Why is there something rather than nothing.</p> <p>https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nothingness/#WhyTheSomRatThaNot</p>"},{"location":"who-is-christ/","title":"Who is Christ?","text":""},{"location":"ancient-views/","title":"Ancient Views","text":""},{"location":"doctrines/","title":"Doctrines","text":""},{"location":"doctrines/mysteries/","title":"Mysteries","text":"<p>http://www.crivoice.org/creeddositheus.html</p> <p>Sacraments, evangelical mysteries</p> <p>And the Mysteries consist of  something natural,  and of something supernatural;  and are not bare signs of the promises of God.
