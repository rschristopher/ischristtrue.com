Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God
Have mercy on me, a sinner

Guide me Lord
That I may articulate your wisdom and your words of prophecy.
Grant me wisdom, eyes to see, ears to hear; that I may know the Spirit of Truth that is in these books; that your words of truth may reach me.
May these pages be for your glory, that I may seek refuge and shelter, that I may be saved, that I may love you Lord, as you have loved me despite my many sins.

Have mercy on me Lord.

<p>In our <a href="../../modern-views/">modern views</a>, prophecy can seem like a relic of the past -- vague predictions or moral lectures that feel disconnected from our daily struggles. We might glance at them for end-times speculation or dismiss them as outdated. But imagine living in an ancient world where kings rose and fell, empires clashed, and ordinary people grappled with injustice and uncertainty. Into this chaos, God sent prophets: not fortune-tellers, but bold spokesmen who delivered divine messages with unflinching honesty. These men confronted power, called out sin, and painted visions of hope amid despair. The Old Testament prophets, active from the 8th to the 5th centuries BC, form a tapestry of judgment, mercy, and promise, divided into the Major Prophets (longer books like Isaiah, Jeremiah with Lamentations, Ezekiel, and Daniel) and the Book of the Twelve (shorter "Minor" Prophets, not lesser in impact). Their words weren't just for their time; they foreshadow Christ and challenge us today. As we delve into them, reflect: In a world of fleeting trends and moral ambiguity, what if these ancient voices still demand our metanoia, urging us to align with God's eternal plan?</p>
<p>The role of a prophet in the Bible was multifaceted. They were God's mouthpieces, holding Israel accountable to the covenant with Yahweh. As the nation strayed into idolatry, social injustice, and alliances with foreign powers, prophets like Amos railed against exploitation of the poor, while others like Isaiah envisioned a coming Messiah who would restore all things. Their messages often blended immediate historical events with long-term eschatological hope -- the "day of the Lord" as both judgment and salvation. This dual focus makes their writings timeless: they diagnose human rebellion while pointing to divine redemption. Historically, prophets emerged during crises, such as the Assyrian and Babylonian threats, serving as God's reminder that history is His story. Thought-provoking: If prophets spoke to power then, what might they say to our global inequalities and spiritual apathy now?</p>

<h2 id="major-prophets">Major Prophets<a class="headerlink" href="#major-prophets" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The Major Prophets deliver expansive narratives, blending personal stories, visions, and oracles. Their longer books address Israel's unfaithfulness, the pain of exile, and the dawn of restoration. Through their lives of suffering and obedience, they model what it means to speak truth to power, inviting us to ponder how God's justice and mercy play out in our own eras of upheaval. These prophets -- Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel -- span from Judah's pre-exile warnings to Babylonian captivity, offering a comprehensive view of God's dealings with His people.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="isaiah">Isaiah<a class="headerlink" href="#isaiah" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Isaiah is a prophet who lived in the 8th century BC, specifically around 739 BC through 701 BC. And, as if to parallel the canonical scriptures, the <em>Book of Isaiah</em> contains 66 chapters and is often considered a Bible within the Bible (with a shift starting in chapter 40, as if to mirror the Old Testament to New Testament division). That said, these chapter divisions are a relatively recent phenomenon by western Christians (starting in the 13th century), and are not a reliable method for exegetic interpretation. Like the scriptures themselves, the Book of Isaiah is best understood in unity and not in discrete parts.</p>
<p>Often referred to as the <em>fifth Gospel</em>, the Book of Isaiah is both prophecy and gospel, with a fractal structure and multiple layers of linear story telling weaved together. There are repeated prophetic themes that apply to the specific historical context of Isaiah's life while simultaneously applying to past and future ages, including the Messianic age.</p>
<p><img alt="isaiah-timeline" src="/images/isaiah-timeline.jpg" /></p>
<p>The overarching theme of the Book of Isaiah is that of man's rebellion against God, with the inevitable consequences of God's divine justice, followed by God's mercy, all culminating in the person of Christ.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Isaiah 1:2 ... 66:23-24</p>
<p>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord. And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.</p>
</div>
<p>Isaiah's ministry occurred during a time of political instability in Judah, as Assyria threatened from the north. He advised kings like Ahaz and Hezekiah, urging trust in God over foreign alliances. His prophecies extend beyond his era, addressing Babylonian exile and ultimate restoration -- a scope that has led some scholars to propose multiple authors, but tradition and New Testament citations affirm single authorship.</p>
<h4 id="commission">Commission<a class="headerlink" href="#commission" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Isaiah tells of the beginning of his prophetic (and evangelical) mission in this extraordinary event:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Isaiah 6:1-8</p>
<p>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</p>
<p>Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.</p>
<p>Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</p>
<p>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.</p>
</div>
<p>The person whom Isaiah sees sitting on the throne is the pre-incarnate Jesus Christ, the Word of God. And the coal offered by the seraphim is a foreshadowing of the Eucharist. The bread and wine, the body and blood of Christ, are as the live coal carried by the seraphim that purges sin. This is why, in ancient churches (and still in many orthodox churches today), after each communion, the priest repeats those prophetic words from Isaiah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold this hath touched thy lips, and taketh away all thine iniquities and purgeth all thy sins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the prophetic wisdom, and as was the case with many of the prophets, speaking truth angered those in power and Isaiah was martyred. In Jewish tradition, and at the time of Christ during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple_period">second temple period</a>, it was understood that Isaiah had been sawn in half by King Manasseh.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Hebrews 11:37-38</p>
<p>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, fell by the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="old-covenant">Old Covenant<a class="headerlink" href="#old-covenant" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The primary context of the Book of Isaiah is the old covenant, that is, Israel's continuous cycle of salvation, rebellion, and exile. This is part of the larger narrative theme that started in Genesis and is fulfilled in the person of Christ Jesus. Specifically it is concerning God's mercy and man's rebellion, culminating in man's salvation through Christ's perfect love for mankind.</p>
<p>Importantly, this pattern persists into the Messianic age, exactly as Isaiah prophecied. We see the same patterns unfolding all around us, even to this day.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Isaiah 3:4-5</p>
<p>And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them. And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Isaiah 3:12</p>
<p>As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.</p>
</div>
<p>As always, we are to turn from our man-made idols, from the nihilism and self-worship of our <a href="../../modern-views/">modern</a> age. We are to seek redemption and mercy from God, not from money nor any man-made idols. The redeemer must be God, and not created.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Isaiah 44:2-3 ... 44:24</p>
<p>Thus saith the Lord that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen. For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Thus saith the Lord, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;</p>
</div>
<p>The old covenant is the foundation from which we can understand the new covenant, and the necessity of Christ. Isaiah shows Israel as a microcosm of humanity: blessed, rebellious, punished, restored -- a pattern inviting self-examination. Why do we repeat cycles of turning from God? His prophecies remind that mercy follows justice for the repentant.</p>
<h4 id="new-covenant">New Covenant<a class="headerlink" href="#new-covenant" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Isaiah lays the groundwork for the Messiah, and what will become the new covenant. And not just allusions to the suffering servant, but specific predictions of His life and the messianic age.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Isaiah 7:14</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</p>
</div>
<p>Famously, <em>Immanuel</em> means "God with us", and the fulfillment of this prophecy is explained in Matthew 1:22-23 as the person of Christ Jesus. And Isaiah makes clear that this Messiah is both man and God.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Isaiah 9:6-7</p>
<p>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.</p>
</div>
<p>Root of Jesse</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Isaiah 11:1-2</p>
<p>And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;</p>
</div>
<p>Jesse is David's father, the savior will come from the lineage of David and sit eternally on the throne of David.</p>

<h4 id="authorship">Authorship<a class="headerlink" href="#authorship" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>There are many modern theories that insist Isaiah was written by multiple authors across several centuries. For example, the so-called <em>deutero-Isaiah</em> (<em>second</em> Isaiah) theory holds that Isaiah 1-39 was written separately from Isaiah 40-66, and there's even a <em>trito-Isaiah</em> theory suggesting that Isaiah 56-66 is from a 3rd author.</p>
<p>Importantly, there's no evidence for multiple authors and this is entirely a modern speculation based on "textual criticism", which is to suggest that there's a different writing style in these sections. Let's examine two passages from these different "styles":</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Isaiah 6:10 | Isaiah 53:1</p>
<p>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</p>
</div>
<p>The conjecture is that these were written centuries apart and by different authors and to different audiences. However, this contradicts the witness of both scripture and tradition.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">John 12:37-41</p>
<p>But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</p>
</div>
<p>The gospel of John confirms it was the same Isaiah, as he quotes from what we call Isaiah 6 and from Isaiah 53, and John connects them with "because Isaiah said again", referring clearly to the same person and not the "Book of Isaiah".</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title"><strong>Textual criticism</strong> that yields wild speculations based on no evidence is likely pointing towards heresy.</p>
</div>
<p>To be clear, there is no evidence and only a modern interpretation of Isaiah to back the notion of multiple authors. The argument is essentially that the "tone" of the earlier sections of Isaiah are different than the later sections, that Isaiah 40-66 is being written to a different audience, specifically to the Jewish diaspora under Babylonian exile. This view does not hold up under scrutiny as earlier sections of Isaiah also use the same prophetic tone, such as in Isaiah 6. And clearly the prophecies are written to a much broader audience, including those at the time of Christ and well after.</p>
<p>Famously, Isaiah 53 makes a clear prophecy with a unique "tone" that is clearly referring to Christ, and it refers to Christ as if those events had already happened. Christ did not arise and ascend during Babylonian exile. The audience for these sections of Isaiah is clearly not specific to Babylonian exile, and in fact the timeline is woven together.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are no ancient copies of Isaiah that stopped at Isaiah 39, which would be an abrupt and awkward stopping place in any age. The evidence points to the contrary, that what we call Isaiah 40-66 was present during the life of the prophet Isaiah. The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Scroll">oldest</a> surviving copy of Isaiah is from the dead sea scrolls and it includes the entirety of what today is Isaiah 1 through 66. There was no seperation between Isaiah 39 and 40, in fact, the partitioning that existed connected 39 and 40 as if they were in the same section.
A competent "textual critic" would notice this with even a cursory read:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Isaiah 39:5-8 - 40:1-5</p>
<p>Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord of hosts: Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord. And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.</p>
<p>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins.</p>
<p>The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</p>
</div>
<p>Clearly, Isaiah 39 does not present a logical ending to Isaiah's prophecy, and in fact the text flows beautifully into the Lord promising comfort from which the stage is set for John the Baptist and the coming of Christ Jesus.
Ancient commentaries from the early church fathers make it clear that Isaiah is to be understood holistically and not piecemeal with different audiences specific to different time periods.</p>
<p>Why would this matter? And why would it be heretical to assume multiple authors?</p>
<p>Breaking Isaiah into different authors forces a context that is otherwise not present; it forces us to imagine that Israel before the Babylonian exile had no access to Isaiah 40-66, which significantly narrows the scope of Isaiah 1-39 (where the pre-incarnate Christ is introduced). By this "textual criticism", the prophecied figure of Christ in Isaiah 53 was only made within the narrow context of Israel living under Babylonian exile.</p>
<p>Multiple authors gives way to eisegetical interpretations, where the "suffering servant" becomes a new and even abstract character introduced by later authors, rather than the person Isaiah saw on the throne in Isaiah 6. This eisegesis (intentionally or otherwise) obscures the text and breaks the continuity of God from the Old Testament, with Christ (God in the New Testament). This heretical view can be refuted by Christ's own words in John as well as by church tradition.</p>
<p>Ultimately, truth is Christ Jesus, the alpha and the omega, not the heretic musings and "textual criticism" from scholars under the sway of the spirit of antichrist (well-intentioned or otherwise).</p>
<p>Isaiah's enduring appeal lies in its poetic depth and theological richness. It invites us to see history as a divine drama, where human failure meets God's faithfulness. In a world craving hope, Isaiah's visions of peace and new creation offer profound comfort -- but only through repentance.</p>

<h3 id="jeremiah-with-lamentations">Jeremiah (with Lamentations)<a class="headerlink" href="#jeremiah-with-lamentations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Jeremiah's life was one of profound sorrow and steadfast obedience. Born around 650 BC in Anathoth, a priestly village near Jerusalem, he was called to prophesy as a young man in 626 BC, during King Josiah's reform. His ministry lasted over 40 years, through five kings, ending with Jerusalem's fall in 586 BC. Known as the "weeping prophet," Jeremiah faced constant opposition: beaten, imprisoned, thrown into a cistern, and labeled a traitor for predicting defeat to Babylon. Yet, he persisted, delivering God's word amid national collapse.</p>
<p>The Book of Jeremiah is a compilation of oracles, narratives, and confessions, not in chronological order but thematic. It condemns Judah's idolatry, social injustices, and false prophets who promised peace while ignoring sin. Jeremiah uses powerful imagery: a boiling pot from the north (1:13) symbolizing Babylonian invasion, a potter reshaping clay (18) illustrating God's sovereignty.</p>
<p>His "confessions" (e.g., 15:10-18) reveal inner turmoil -- cursing his birth, yet recommitting to God's call. The message: Exile is divine punishment for covenant breach, but restoration follows. The new covenant promise (31:31-34) -- law on hearts, sins forgiven -- is a cornerstone, fulfilled in Christ (Hebrews 8).</p>
<p>Lamentations, traditionally Jeremiah's, is five acrostic poems mourning Jerusalem's destruction. It blends graphic horror (starving children, cannibalism) with theological reflection: Sin caused this, but God's mercies are new every morning (3:22-23).</p>
<p>Jeremiah teaches endurance in adversity: Truth often costs dearly, but obedience bears eternal fruit. Thought-provoking: In our "prosperity gospel" era, does his suffering challenge easy faith? His new covenant invites introspection -- is God's law inscribed on our hearts?</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Jeremiah 31:33</p>
<p>But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>

<p>Ezekiel's prophecy is a whirlwind of visions and symbolism, delivered from Babylonian exile (593-571 BC). A priest by birth, he was taken captive in 597 BC, settling in Tel-abib by the Chebar canal. His call came at 30, the age for priestly service -- a poignant reminder of his displaced life.</p>
<p>The book opens with a theophany: a chariot-throne with four living creatures (cherubim), wheels full of eyes, carrying God's glory (chapter 1). This mobile presence shows God isn't confined to Jerusalem. Ezekiel's acts are bizarre: eating a scroll (3), lying bound for 430 days (4), shaving his head (5) -- dramatizing siege and exile.</p>
<p>Themes: God's glory departs the corrupt Temple (10-11), but returns to a renewed one (43). Individual responsibility: No more blaming ancestors (18). Restoration: New heart and Spirit (36:26), dry bones living (37) -- vivid resurrection imagery.</p>
<p>Messianic: Prince among people (34:24), echoing Davidic shepherd. Ezekiel's ministry, marked by personal loss (wife's death as sign, 24:15-18), models sacrificial calling.</p>
