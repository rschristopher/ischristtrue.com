no objectively knowable truth, reality was determined by the gods to which man is but a plaything.

the innovation of Judaism was that man is created in the image and likeness of God, all men, no hierarchy or caste.

Masculinity in the Christian world

Masculinity in the modern world

The industrial revolution increasingly took fathers out of the family business and into factories, a trend we see exacerbated during periods such as the great depression (tractors changing the economic reality of family farms). And as the trend continued so too rose the attack on masculinity, as this disruption in the natural order (breaking families) results in an ancient pagan kind of masculinity -- where we have the toxic varieties combined with sneaky fuckers and eunuchs (castrated men).

Secular masculinity is essentially rediscovering the pre-Christian archetypes of men, and it is demonic and anti-Christian


Christian masculinity is man as head of the household, protecting and raising his children, ministering to his family and worshipping God.
