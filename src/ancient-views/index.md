no objectively knowable truth, reality was determined by the gods to which mankind is but a plaything.

The innovation of Judaism was that man is created in the image and likeness of God, all of us. 
Christianity is the inevitable fulfillment of that prophetic worldview.
Implicit in this is the abolition of slavery (which happened due to Christianity), and explicit is human rights and dignity (which propagated with the success of Christianity).
As a result, even the most hard-nosed atheist will use a Christian ethic to criticize modern Christianity.

Importantly, these are innovations. There are no ancient pre-Jewish sources for universal human rights and dignity. There was caste systems, slavery, and oppression from gods and their various priests. We were ruled by principalities and powers. They didn't just tempt us, they had real power over our lives and our bodies.

Importantly, the pre-Christian world recognized no implicit value in a human life. A person's value was not earned by merit -- value was granted by the gods, usually played out based on the caste you were born into.
In this view men have no value and neither do women.
The roles adopted by men and women were about survival in a world of gods that cared little about your survival.

We can see glimpses of this today in the modern gender debate. 
The modern view has lately believed in a man-made patriarchy, hence the latest destructive revolution is to "dismantle the patriarchy", or to "decolonize" whatever institution have power and influence (an obvious euphemistic way to say; take over the institution for yourself).

But what are the fruits of these activist movements?
Modern progressive will claim that all the rights women now enjoy are due to this activism, completely ignoring that human rights and dignity were due to a prior generation's Christian ethic. 
The modern activists have instead brought us wide scale chemical castration, genital mutilation, normalization of sexual deviance (making one's sexual desire an idol), and the dismantling of knowable truth, to name but a few of the nihilistic fruits of our modern endeavors.

This is a clear regression into an ancient pre-Christian worldview.

We imagine there's a battle of the sexes -- male versus female -- while simultaneously denying a gender binary. Masculinity is considered "toxic" unless it's coming from a women, which then makes her "brave". Femininity is scorned unless it's aped by a man identifying as a woman.

Where did this all begin? Turns out it's older than we think. We find the same "battle of the sexes" rhetoric going back hundreds of years, pointing back to the industrial revolution and the so-called age of enlightenment.

The industrial revolution increasingly took fathers out of the family business (mostly farms) and into factories, a trend we see exacerbated during periods such as the great depression (tractors changing the economic reality of family farms). And as the trend continued so too rose the attacks on masculinity. 
Note that each *wave* of feminism was proceeded by major erosions to the family.
At the same time, we see enlightenment-era thinkers rationalizing these problems in Darwinian terms, that in the survival of the fittest men had dominated women (nevermind the sheer stupidity of such an assertion).

This ongoing disruption in the natural order (breaking families) results in an ancient pagan kind of gender roles -- where we have glimpses of the old idols. We see polygamy and sneaky fuckers and eunuchs (castrated men).


Secular masculinity is reverting to the pre-Christian archetypes of men, and it is clearly demonic and anti-Christian.

Similarly, secular feminity is reducing women, paradoxically replacing femininity with masculine energy as the only valuable energy. Beauty and grace are replaced with fashion and idolatry, ironically played out mostly by biological men (further reducing women into slavish participants).

See Aristotle's view of women to better understand what a pre-Christian view about women looked like. And note this is the end result of the secular view.


Secular gender roles have not empowered anyone but reduced God-given human rights to "privileges", things granted by the powers and principalities, the false gods of our worship -- we've come to believe these false gods can take those "privileges" away.




Importantly, traditional Christianity restores man and woman to their God-given roles, as icons of God.

Monasticism and Marriage, two callings, 

Marriage as the path for raising children in a consecrated union. 
Monasticism is a consecrated celibacy, a divine spiritual calling. 
The two paths can often intertwine and are mutually supportive of the other.

In a Christian marriage, 
Man is the head of the household, protecting and raising children, ministering to his wife and worshipping God.
Woman is the heart of the family, nurturing and raising children, ministering to her husband and worshipping God.

Through their love comes children, and the strengthening of family bonds. This is the core and foundational unit from which Christ defeats his enemies.
For he is ruling in the midst of His enemies, and to align ourselves with Christ is to make ourselves like David in his battle with Goliath.
