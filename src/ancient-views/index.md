Our [modern](../modern-views/index.md) worldview of enlightenment and secularism is blatantly failing; failing not only to advance civilization but also failing to sustain civilization.
We all feel this on a gut level, as if there's forces at work actively seeking to harm us.
We can blame globalism or populism or whatever machination of political elites, but these are mere symptoms, the rotten fruits of a deeper nihilism.
As a result of our failing worldview, we should expect an inevitable resurgence of ancient worldviews as we seek answers to the fundamental questions that our modern worldview view simply cannot answer.

To be clear, this is not a voluntary return to ancient religions.
Ancient worldviews are returning to us whether we like it or not.
These are ancient patterns of reality that are manifesting in the midst of the decay of western civilization.

To put it bluntly: the old gods are returning.








## What is a worldview?

A worldview is a set of beliefs and presuppositions needed to think, plan, and act in the world.
It is how we "make sense" of the world.
This includes the patterns of reality that we participate in.

All worldviews attempt to "make sense" of all other worldviews, subordinating those competing worldviews under a unifying principle.
These are attempts at integrating all observed behavior and phenomena into a coherent model that "makes sense" of everything (including the existence of different worldviews).


!!! example "pantheons and archetypes"
    Each worldview attempts to subordinate other worldviews through syncretism, that is, combining the competing religious principles under a higher principle. For example:
    
    * The Romans added the gods of conquered people to their pantheon, subordinating the foreign gods (competing worldviews) under Rome: worshipping those gods in temples and giving them Latin names, e.g., Athena became Minerva, Zeus became Jupiter, etc.
    
    * Our modern worldview subordinates competing worldviews by falsification and secularism, e.g., we claim Zeus and Athena are not real, that they're make believe, but that everyone is still free to practice whatever religion they want. Note the presupposition of knowable objective truth in this view.

Worldviews are not optional, and there is no "neutral" nor "unbiased" worldview.
Everything we experience and understand is based on our current worldview.
This includes moral judgments, purpose, meaning, and knowledge about ourselves and the universe.

Worldviews are not thoughts nor mere beliefs. 
We cannot think our way into a new worldview. 
Worldviews are the presuppositions needed to even have thoughts.
We adopt new worldviews only as a psychological reaction to persistent anomalies in our existing worldview. 
A worldview is in a sense empirically validated by its coherence and lack of anomaly (that is, when everything "makes sense").

If we experience anomalies (things that don't make sense) we will seek to integrate the anomalous phenomena into our worldview -- failure to do so results in a kind of existential crisis (and hysteria) until a new worldview is adopted which can better make sense of the new phenomena.

Worldviews are not all equal. Some are clearly more survivable and amenable to human flourishing than others.
An interesting trait of the 
 [modern](../modern-views/index.md)
 [enlightenment](../modern-views/enlightenment.md) worldview is that it assumes ancient worldviews were superstitious and incomplete, products of "less evolved" and "pre-scientific" thinking.
In the enlightenment worldview we imagine there's a list of different religious systems that we can pick and choose from, defaulting to "none" (as atheists are want to do).
We then imagine that people of other religions are those who chose differently, usually defaulting to the religion they were born into.
This approach only works when everyone in a society agrees to the enlightenment worldview as a higher principle to all other worldviews.












## Failure of the modern worldview

Western civilization was born from a Christian worldview.
Unfortunately, we succumbed to pride, starting in the age of scholasticism and again in the [enlightenment](../modern-views/enlightenment.md), which produced our modern rationalistic secular worldview, denying God and it is now producing nihilism.
Our secular worldview had been subordinating ancient worldviews, pushing them beneath our own intellect and passions.
When we claim ancient worldviews are "superstitious nonsense", we are presupposing knowable objective truth, that we *know* what is and what is not truth (and thus what is nonsense).
Ironically, this nihilistic worldview has become the default worldview that we in our modern age are born into (worship of self).

This is why we've seen so many shallow modern religions in western culture, because we are subordinating the ancient religious traditions of our ancestors into our secularism.
This is why, for example, so many people in modern churches don't seem to actually believe what they're preaching (because they don't believe it -- if they did they would behave very differently).

So what happens when this subordinating principle fails, when we can't subordinate the ancient gods beneath our intellect and passions? What happens when those competing worldviews (the ancient gods) are no longer subordinated?

We are living through exactly such a failure.
As modernism gives way to postmodernism and nihilism, that is, the rejection of knowable objective truth, than gone too is the subordinating principle that kept those ancient worldviews bound to their respective mythology textbooks.
We are thus experiencing powers and principalities that early Christians  understood as demonic, which were very much part of the struggles of daily life.

!!! quote "Ephesians 6:12"
    For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.










## Return of ancient worldviews 

Ancient worldviews all share a basic presupposition: there is no objective knowable truth, reality is determined by the gods to which mankind is but a plaything.

It was in this context that Judaism changed everything in the ancient world.
The first innovation of Judaism was the radical assertion that man is created in the image and likeness of the creator of the universe.
This was an outrageous claim.
Ancient worldviews understood that man was nothing to the gods but at most idle amusement like a child playing with ants.
The second innovation was a monotheistic God who was transcendent to creation, to the "gods" of worldly worship.
In fact, those "gods" turned out to be fallen spirits in the Jewish worldview.
And explicit in the Jewish worldview was universal human rights and dignity (which propagated into the entire world with the success of Christianity).

The modern enlightenment worldview attempted to maintain the Christian ethic but without Christ.
In our pride we wanted to dispense with God but keep the morality of being created in the image and likeness of God.
Even today, hard-nosed atheists will often use a Christian ethic to criticize modern Christianity.
Unfortunately, as we follow the nihilistic depredation of truth, we're left with moral relativism and a return of pre-Christian morality.

To be clear: there is no ancient pre-Jewish sources for universal human rights and dignity. There was caste systems, slavery, and oppression from "gods" and their various priests. There was genocide, cannibalism, and ritualized child sacrifice. We were ruled by principalities and powers. Demonic spirits didn't just tempt us, they had real power over our lives and our bodies, even the lives of our children.

The ancient pre-Christian world did not recognize any implicit value to human life. 
A person's value was was granted by the gods (the principalities that ruled over us), which meant that there can be no inalienable rights, and no intrinsic value to a human life, which is exactly what is resurfacing today.

To be clear, what is emerging today as our modern worldview caves into nihilism, is the erosion of human value and human rights, and the emergence of powers and principalities that have dominion over us (where rights become privileges, all at the whims of systems that no one quite understands).
We mistakenly believe this is something new, some kind of technological fascism, but it turns out, it is very ancient.













### Ancient sexual idolatry 

Sex and gender roles in ancient times were about survival in a world of gods that cared little about our survival (if not openly antagonist to our survival).
Polygamy was the norm, not marriage as we understand it today. 
There were harems, eunuchs, homosexuality, and pedophilia -- all completely normalized.
These weren't immoral things, because the ruling principalities embraced and encouraged them.

There was also procreation with these "gods", such as the ubiquitous god-kings of the ancient world, or what the Bible refers to as Nephilim.

We are witnessing the re-emergence of this ancient sexual idolatry. 
Modern "intellectuals" and activists talk of "the patriarchy", and the latest destructive revolution is to "dismantle the patriarchy", or to "decolonize" whatever institution they believe has power and influence (a euphemistic way to say: let's take over the institutions).

But what are the fruits of these activist movements?

Modern progressive will claim that all the rights women now enjoy are due to this activism, completely ignoring that human rights and dignity were due to a prior generation's Christian ethic (the very rights that modern activism is eroding). 
The modern activists have instead brought us wide-scale chemical castration, genital mutilation, normalization of sexual deviance (making one's sexual desire an idol), and the dismantling of knowable truth, to name but a few of the nihilistic fruits of our modern views.

This is a clear regression into ancient sexual idolatry, where once dormant spirits are resurfacing as principles of worship.









### Ancient gender roles

We imagine today that there's an ongoing battle of the sexes -- male versus female -- while simultaneously denying a gender binary. 
Masculinity is considered "toxic" unless it's coming from a women, which then makes her "brave". 
Femininity is scorned unless it's aped by a man identifying as a woman.

To an enlightenment-era rationalist this would all seems absurd, but that's because rationalism fails to account for this very real phenomena.
However, if we look to ancient worldviews then this all makes perfect sense.
This absurdity merely reflects the ancient gender roles resurfacing.

We can find the "battle of the sexes" rhetoric emerging in the industrial revolution and in the so-called age of enlightenment.
Importantly, this rhetoric did not exist in early Christianity nor in Judaism.

The industrial revolution increasingly took fathers out of the family business (mostly farms) and into factories, a trend we see exacerbated during periods such as the 
 *Great Depression* 
 (where tractors changed the economic reality of family farms). 
And as this trend continued (breaking up families) so too emerged feminist attacks on masculinity. 

Consider that every "wave" of feminism was *proceeded* by erosions to the nuclear family.
And just as modern "intellectuals" explain this as progress, we saw enlightenment-era "intellectuals" rationalizing these problems in Darwinian terms, that men had dominated women in an evolutionary sense. 

This ongoing breakdown of families results in the emergence of ancient gender roles. 
We see today polygamy and 
 [sneaky fuckers](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/kleptogyny)
 and eunuchs (castrated men) and many many disposable men and women.
We see abhorrent sexual behavior normalized and treated as if it's innovative and new, rather than more of the same ancient demonism.

Secular "masculinity" is emasculating men into a pre-Christian archetype of slavish obedience to the powers and principalities ruling over us. 
This in turn creates reactionary masculinity leading to violence which only strengthens the principalities.
This is clearly demonic and anti-Christian.

Similarly, secular feminity is diminishing the value of women, paradoxically replacing femininity with masculine energy as the only valuable energy (putting women in a decided disadvantage in the battle of the sexes they imagine themselves playing).
Beauty and grace are replaced with fashion and idolatry, ironically played out most successfully by biological men pretending to be women (further reducing the value of women such that biological men now routinely become "woman of the year").

The end result of this nihilistic program is to devalue men and women back into ancient gender roles.
Rather than being made in the image and likeness of God to minister to one another in marriage, men and women become as valueless as they were in the ancient world.
See Aristotle's view of women to better understand ancient views about women and where this is all headed.

!!! warning "Aristotle"
    The female is as it were a deformed male

The consequences of activists and liberation movements have not empowered or liberated anyone, but instead degraded God-given human rights into "privileges", things granted by the powers and principalities, the false gods of modern worship.
We've even come to believe these false gods can take those "privileges" away.
Always remember, human rights are God-given and can never be taken away by demonic powers.












### Ancient "gods"

As our modern worldview continues its nihilistic program, we see the resurgence of ancient idols, symbols of ancient "gods". 
These are the ancient powers and principalities making themselves manifest.

Let's explore some examples.


???+ example "Kali Maa"
    ![kali](/images/kali.jpg)

[Kali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali) is the Hindu goddess of destruction and creation.
And for reasons that should surprise no one, Kali symbolism is emerging in the decay of western secularism (which otherwise never had much Hindu influence).
We see this intentionally in the [Rolling Stones Logo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue_and_lips_logo), [Jungian archetypes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes) of the devouring mother, and countless novels and comics.

While this is arguably a perversion of orthodox Hinduism, the symbolism is clear and even western feminists are appropriating Kali Maa quite explicitly.

???+ example "Ms. magazine cover in 1972"
    ![kali-ms](/images/kali-ms.jpg)

And should anyone think this is benign and some misunderstanding or misrepresentation, here is a more recent article that makes these claims [explicit](https://qz.com/1768545/hinduisms-kali-is-the-feminist-icon-the-world-desperately-needs):

> This makes Kali the feminist icon we need today, in that she is a complex figure of many contrasting traits, all of which are equally worthy expressions of female strength—unapologetic because it doesn’t even consider that there could be anything to apologise for.

While a sincere scholar of Hinduism could say this is a blatant "misunderstanding" of Kali, and of course that's true, but the spirit symbolized by Kali iconography is very clear within the nihilistic decay of western secularism. 
It is demonic and completely unbounded by any pretense of goodness or truth.
Try to articulate an honest truth claim about Kali that all cultures that worship Kali would agree with.
What fruits do we see from Kali worship?

## Messianic Age 

...
Fortunately, the ancient gods have no real power, and have already been defeated by Christ.

Importantly, we are not in the ancient pre-Christian world. We are in the messianic age where Christ is ruling in the midst of His enemies.

Traditional Christianity restores man and woman to their God-given roles, as icons of God.
This is available to everyone, right now -- Christ is calling us to participate in His victory as He crushes the serpent's seeds.

In the ancient Christian view, what do traditional gender roles look like?

Monasticism and Marriage, two callings, 

Marriage is the path for raising children in a consecrated union. 
Monasticism is a consecrated celibacy, a divine spiritual calling. 
The two paths intertwine and are mutually supportive of one another -- in fact, these represent the two natures of Christ, for Christ is both man and God. Christ was born of a good marriage and lived in the world as a carpenter, and yet he simultaneously lived in consecrated celibacy, preaching and fulfilling the law.

In a Christian marriage, 
the husband/father is the head of the household, protecting and raising children, ministering to his wife and worshipping God.
The wife/mother is the heart of the family, nurturing and raising children, ministering to her husband and worshipping God.

Through the love between husband and wife comes children and the strengthening of family.
Let us remember the value of a single human life to God.
The saints of the monastics bring us revelations from God.
The saints of marriage and family is the core foundation from which Christ defeats His enemies.
For He is ruling in the midst of His enemies, and to align ourselves with Christ is to make ourselves like David in his battle with Goliath.





How ought Christians subordinate competing worldviews?

In other words, what is the orthodox worldview for subordinating pagan views?


!!! quote "Matthew 7:5"
    Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.


Christ is truth, meaning that through Christ truth is knowable, and the other worldviews are making deceptive and false claims -- these are fallen spirits with dominion over humans, but Christ rules in the midst of His enemies and we can let Christ into our hearts, saving our so
uls.
