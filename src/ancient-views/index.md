Our [modern](../modern-views/index.md) worldview of continuous destructive revolution and nihilistic secularism is blatantly failing; failing not only to advance civilization but also failing to sustain civilization.
We all know this on a gut level, that something is not quite right, and it's only getting worse.
As a result, we should expect an inevitable resurgence of ancient worldviews as we seek answers to the fundamental questions that our modern view simply cannot answer.

To be clear, this is not a voluntary return to ancient worldviews.
Ancient worldviews are returning to us whether we like it or not.
These are ancient patterns of reality that are manifesting in the midst of the decay of western civilization.

To put it plainly; the old gods are returning.








## What is a worldview?

A worldview is a set of beliefs and presuppositions needed to think, plan, and act in the world.
These are the patterns of reality that we participate in.
All worldviews (if they are honest) attempt to "make sense" of all other worldviews, subordinating the competing worldviews under a higher principle.
These are attempts at unifying observed behavior and phenomena into a coherent model that "makes sense" of everything.


!!! example "pantheons and archetypes"
    A common method of subordinating competing worldviews is through syncretism, that is, combining various religious principles under a higher principle. For example:
    
    * The Romans added the gods of conquered people to their pantheon, subordinating those foreign gods (competing worldviews) under Rome: worshipped in temples and given Latin names, e.g., Athena to Minerva, Zeus to Jupiter, etc.
    
    * Our modern worldview subordinates competing worldviews to falsification and secularism, e.g., Zeus and Athena are not real, at most archetypal patterns of reality, but you're free to practice whatever religion you want.



Worldviews are not optional and there is no "neutral" or "unbiased" worldview.
Everything we experience and understand is based on our current worldview.
This includes moral judgments, purpose, meaning, and knowledge about ourselves and the universe.

Worldviews are not thoughts. We cannot think our way into a new worldview. Worldviews are the presuppositions needed to even have thoughts.

Worldviews are not all equal...

We adopt new worldviews only as a psychological response to persistent anomalies in our existing worldview.
Anomalies and Sense Making...

An interesting trait of the 
 [modern](../modern-views/index.md) secular worldview is that it assumes ancient worldviews were superstitious and incomplete, products of "less evolved" and "pre-scientific" thinking.
We imagine there's a list of different religious systems that we can pick and choose from, maybe even choose "none" from the list (as atheists are want to do). 
Then we imagine people of other religions are those who chose differently, usually defaulting to the religion they were born into.
What we're doing is subordinating competing worldviews into a higher principle, making the highest principle our own intellect and passions.
Ironically, this is the default worldview that we in our modern age are born into (worship of self).

This is why we see so many shallow modern religions, because they are subordinating the ancient views of their ancestors into modern secularism.
This is why, for example, so many people in modern churches don't seem to actually believe what they're preaching (because they don't believe it -- if they did they would behave very differently).

So what happens when secularism fails? What happens when this ordering principle that subordinates all those ancient worldviews fails to hold everything together?








Worldview are syncretic by nature, *even* and especially the 
 [modern worldview](../modern-views/index.md).
Western secularism attempts to "make sense" of other worldviews by falsification, hence the inevitable nihilism that follows secularism, and the postmodern reactions that make nihilism explicit.






???+ example "Kali Maa"
    ![kali](/images/kali.jpg)

    The "goddess" [Kali](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali) in all her destructive devouring glory. We are witnessing exactly this spirit in the modeen world, emerging in the west through feminism as a destructive force. We see explicit signs of this in 1972:

    ![kali-ms](/images/kali-ms.jpg)

    And should anyone think this is benign and some misunderstanding or misrepresentation, here is more recent article that makes these claims even more [explicit](https://qz.com/1768545/hinduisms-kali-is-the-feminist-icon-the-world-desperately-needs):

    > This makes Kali the feminist icon we need today, in that she is a complex figure of many contrasting traits, all of which are equally worthy expressions of female strength—unapologetic because it doesn’t even consider that there could be anything to apologise for.





 

Ancient Pagan views are the background for which we can best understand Christianity and how it succeeded against seemingly overwhelming opposition.

[alchemy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy) 




no objectively knowable truth, reality was determined by the gods to which mankind is but a plaything.

The innovation of Judaism was that man is created in the image and likeness of God, all of us. 
Christianity is the inevitable fulfillment of that prophetic Hebrew worldview.
Implicit in this is the abolition of slavery (which happened due to Christianity), and explicit is human rights and dignity (which propagated with the success of Christianity into the world).
As a result, even the most hard-nosed atheist will use a Christian ethic to criticize modern Christianity.

There are no ancient pre-Jewish sources for universal human rights and dignity. There was caste systems, slavery, and oppression from gods and their various priests. There was genocide, cannibalism, and ritualized child sacrifice. We were ruled by principalities and powers. They didn't just tempt us, they had real power over our lives and our bodies, even the lives of our children.

The pre-Christian world did not recognize any implicit value in a human life. A person's value was not earned by merit -- value was granted by the gods.
In this view men have no value and neither do women.

The ancient gender roles adopted by men and women were about survival in a world of gods that cared little about our survival (if not openly antagonist to our survival).
Polygamy was the norm, not marriage as we understand it today. There were harems, eunuchs, homosexuality, and normalized pedophilia. We find this in almost every ancient pagan history.
We also have procreation with the gods, what the Bible refers to as Nephilim.

We can see glimpses of these ancient gender roles today in the modern gender debate. 
The modern view has lately believed in a man-made patriarchy, hence the latest destructive revolution is to "dismantle the patriarchy", or to "decolonize" whatever institution have power and influence (an obvious euphemistic way to say; take over the institution for yourself).

But what are the fruits of these activist movements?
Modern progressive will claim that all the rights women now enjoy are due to this activism, completely ignoring that human rights and dignity were due to a prior generation's Christian ethic. 
The modern activists have instead brought us wide scale chemical castration, genital mutilation, normalization of sexual deviance (making one's sexual desire an idol), and the dismantling of knowable truth, to name but a few of the nihilistic fruits of our modern views.

This is a clear regression into an ancient pre-Christian worldview, specifically re-creating ancient gender roles.

We imagine there's a battle of the sexes -- male versus female -- while simultaneously denying a gender binary. Masculinity is considered "toxic" unless it's coming from a women, which then makes her "brave". Femininity is scorned unless it's aped by a man identifying as a woman. To a rationalist this all seems, but that's simply because rationalism fails to account for this very real phenomena.

Where did this all begin? Turns out it's older than we think. We find the same "battle of the sexes" rhetoric going back hundreds of years, pointing back to the industrial revolution and the so-called age of enlightenment.

The industrial revolution increasingly took fathers out of the family business (mostly farms) and into factories, a trend we see exacerbated during periods such as the great depression (tractors changing the economic reality of family farms). And as the trend continued so too rose feminist attacks on masculinity. 
Note that each *wave* of feminism was proceeded by major erosions to the family.
At the same time, we see enlightenment-era thinkers rationalizing these problems in Darwinian terms, that in the survival of the fittest men had dominated women (nevermind the sheer stupidity of such an assertion).

This ongoing disruption in the natural order (breaking families) results in ancient pagan gender roles -- where we have glimpses of the old idols. We see polygamy and sneaky fuckers and eunuchs (castrated men) and many many disposable men and women.


Secular masculinity is reverting men to the pre-Christian archetypes, and it is clearly demonic and anti-Christian.

Similarly, secular feminity is reducing women, paradoxically replacing femininity with masculine energy as the only valuable energy (putting women in a decided disadvantage in the battle of the sexes they imagine themselves playing). Beauty and grace are replaced with fashion and idolatry, ironically played out most successfully by biological men (further reducing women into slavish participants where biological men become the "womem of the year").

See Aristotle's view of women to better understand what a pre-Christian view about women looked like. And note this is the end result of the secular view.


Secular gender roles have not empowered anyone but reduced God-given human rights to "privileges", things granted by the powers and principalities, the false gods of our worship.
We've come to believe these false gods can take those "privileges" away.
Fortunately, those gods have no real power, and have already been defeated by Christ.
We are living through the messianic age, where Christ is ruling in the midst of His enemies.



Importantly, traditional Christianity restores man and woman to their God-given roles, as icons of God.
This is available to everyone, right now -- Christ is calling us to participate in His victory as He crushes the serpent's seeds.

In the ancient Christian view, what do traditional gender roles look like?

Monasticism and Marriage, two callings, 

Marriage is the path for raising children in a consecrated union. 
Monasticism is a consecrated celibacy, a divine spiritual calling. 
The two paths intertwine and are mutually supportive of one another -- in fact, these represent the two natures of Christ, for Christ is both man and God. Christ was born of a good marriage and lived in the world as a carpenter, and yet he simultaneously lived in consecrated celibacy, preaching and fulfilling the law.

In a Christian marriage, 
the husband/father is the head of the household, protecting and raising children, ministering to his wife and worshipping God.
The wife/mother is the heart of the family, nurturing and raising children, ministering to her husband and worshipping God.

Through the love between husband and wife comes children and the strengthening of family.
Let us remember the value of a single human life to God.
The saints of the monastics bring us revelations from God.
The saints of marriage and family is the core foundation from which Christ defeats His enemies.
For He is ruling in the midst of His enemies, and to align ourselves with Christ is to make ourselves like David in his battle with Goliath.
