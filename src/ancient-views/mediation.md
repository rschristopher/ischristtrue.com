Christ mediates between us and
 God the Father.
And more, Christ mediates
 between us and the seen
 and unseen world of creation,
 of which we are part of and 
 one with.
As you look out onto the world,
 and see the familiar faces of
 family and friends, Christ
 is there as mediator still.
The Holy Spirit is there,
 as God is omnipresent.
And yet, so too is the Son
 omnipresent in his role as
 mediator.

The infinity of perceptions that
 we regularly navigate, Christ is there.
The Son of God is there, and through
 Him we can once again come to the
 Father.





... what is a mediator?
What is a mediating principle?
The necessary steps between your current fallen state, and the goal, the aim, in this case the being in the presence of God from within creation.
