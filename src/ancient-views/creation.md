> our behavior is directly linked to our understanding of our origins, and our behavior reveals our desire or lack thereof for salvation and eternal life, to which Genesis, as a book of Scripture, points us.

> teaching that men are descended from apes in order to justify treating one another as animals.

> Fr. Seraphim writes that a vague understanding of the future age of blessedness, leaving men open to chiliastic theories of a “paradise on earth,” is due in large part to a poor understanding of the origin of man and the universe.

> St. Basil the Great writes: “Those who do not admit the common meaning of the Scriptures … have attempted by false arguments and allegorical interpretations to bestow on the Scripture a dignity of their own imagining. But theirs is the attitude of one who considers himself wiser than the revelations of the Spirit and introduces his own ideas in pretense of an explanation. Therefore, let it be understood as it has been written.”

> and against those who reject the plain meaning of Genesis, St. John Chrysostom exhorts: “let us pay no heed to these people, let us stop up our hearing against them, and let us believe the Divine Scripture, and following what is written in it, let us strive to preserve in our souls sound dogmas.”

> As Fr. Seraphim takes his cue from the Fathers, so the Fathers took their cue from Scripture itself which declares that God spoke to Moses, not in dark sayings and riddles but face-to-face as a friend (Num. 12:6-8)

> Of course, no man has or can directly observe the creation of the world apart from spiritual vision, but it can only be guessed at by extrapolating from the modern world that we do experience. Only God Himself observed in real time the creation of the world and therefore only God can reveal the un-speculative truth of it to man.

> as Fr. Seraphim himself would say, we cannot rely on our own rational understanding of the Holy Scriptures, but we must instead ask how the holy Fathers have understood the days of Creation.
