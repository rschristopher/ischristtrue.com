# Creation

<!--
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God
Have mercy on me, a sinner

Protect me from the evil one.
Enlighten my mind and my heart so that your wisdom may be revealed and articulated, all for your glory.

We tend to misunderstand the doctrine of creation, assuming it must align with modern scientific theories like evolution, when in fact the ancient patristic view reveals a profound, literal truth rooted in divine revelation. 
In seeking whether Christ is true, we must confront how our understanding of origins shapes our behavior, our pursuit of salvation, and our openness to eternal life. 
A vague or distorted view of creation opens the door to errors, from treating one another as mere animals to chasing illusory paradises on earth.

!!! quote "Genesis 1:1-3"
    In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

## Modern Misunderstandings

In our age, cosmogony -- the origin and development of the universe -- is often framed through a secular lense, presupposing vast eons and evolutionary processes while ignoring the deeper questions of existence and creation.
This misses the divine story of order emerging from chaos, as revealed in Scripture. 
Fr. Seraphim Rose warns that such views, including theistic evolution, portray God as insufficient, reducing His direct acts to natural mechanisms -- which means creation itself must be eternal and self-sustaining. 
This philosophy, clearly not a science, contradicts the patristic witness and fosters [nihilism](../modern-views/nihilism.md), denying the Incarnation and aligning with the spirit of [antichrist](antichrist.md).

Teaching descent from apes justifies animalistic behavior, as Fr. Seraphim notes, while a poor grasp of origins leads to [chiliastic](../modern-views/millennialism.md) dreams of earthly utopia. 
The fossil record and scientific claims, often biased or fraudulent (e.g., Piltdown Man), cannot penetrate the pre-fallen world, which are accessible only through revelation. 
Only God observed creation (outside of time, for time is an artifact of creation).
God revealed this truth to Moses face-to-face, not in obscure metaphors and riddles.

!!! quote "Fr. Seraphim Rose"
    Evolution would never have been thought of by men who believe in the God whom Orthodox Christians worship.

## Patristic Interpretation

The Holy Fathers urge a literal understanding of Genesis, rejecting allegories and over-rationalized symbolism, such as all the Jungian metaphors and psychedelic inferences that captivate the modern mind. 
St. Basil the Great condemns those who, through specious arguments, bestow on Scripture a "dignity of their own imagining," insisting instead that Holy Scripture be understood as they are written.

Likewise, St. John Chrysostom exhorts us to heed the Divine Scripture and preserve sound dogmas, while St. Ephraim the Syrian deems it impermissible to allegorize the six days.

!!! quote "St. John Chrysostom"
    let us pay no heed to these people, let us stop up our hearing against them, and let us believe the Divine Scripture, and following what is written in it, let us strive to preserve in our souls sound dogmas.

This consensus affirms instantaneous creation each day, with species fixed "according to their kind," not transforming as evolution claims. Adam was formed from dust, Eve from his rib -- unique acts, not evolutionary steps. 
Before the Fall, creation was incorrupt: no death, nor carnivory, nor decay; animals ate plants, and man walked with God in grace.

Evolution is very much life reacting to death, and without death we cannot fathom evolution or even *time* itself -- leaving these early moments of creation very much a mystery that has only been revealed in Scripture (transcendent to the very artifacts of creation that our modern view so arrogantly assumes must be the totality of existence).

St. Theophilus of Antioch and Julius Africanus argue against pagan "old earth" notions, aligning with Scriptural genealogies. We must not rely on rationalism but instead ask how the Fathers understood creation, for true knowledge comes not from speculation, but only from divine revelation.

!!! quote "St. Basil the Great"
    Those who do not admit the common meaning of the Scriptures â€¦ have attempted by false arguments and allegorical interpretations to bestow on the Scripture a dignity of their own imagining. But theirs is the attitude of one who considers himself wiser than the revelations of the Spirit and introduces his own ideas in pretense of an explanation. Therefore, let it be understood as it has been written.

## The Days of Creation

Both fundamentalist and evolutionist views miss the mark, presupposing a mechanistic and secular worldview. 
The Fathers teach literal days of 24 hours, with "evening and morning" marking each, and yet God's acts were immediate within them. 
God is outside of, and not bound by, time.
God is the author of time -- literally speaking time and space into existence.
The consensus has always been that the *incarnate* (not *pre-incarnate*) Christ created the world.
We would be wise not to bind the creator of time within created time
 -- we do not worship [Chronos ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronos). 
 We worship the God-man Jesus Christ.
 Who in the beginning was with God, and is God.

!!! quote "John 1:1-5"
    In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.

St. Ephraim notes creation began in spring, emphasizing historical reality.
The six days reflect increasing perfection, culminating in man -- not geological epochs. 
St. Maximus the Confessor links time and eternity: "eternity is time when it stops moving, and time is eternity when it is measured." 
In union with God, as in pre-fallen Adam, man transcends time's change. 
This mystery eludes science, for the first-created world differs profoundly from our fallen one.

!!! quote "St. Ephraim the Syrian"
    Although both the light and the clouds were created in the twinkling of an eye, still both the day and the night of the First Day continued for twelve hours each.

## Theological Implications

Our origins directly link our behavior to our salvation: understanding creation as incorrupt, then fallen, and everything pointing to our redemption in Christ. 
The [Fall of Man](fall.md) introduced death and corruption -- bodily desires, predation, decay -- absent before. 
This bears repeating -- life as it was created, as it was intended (and declared "very good" by our Lord), is not compatible with death, nor evolution, nor any of our modern preconceptions of time.

!!! quote "Romans 8:22"
    For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.

Virginity reigned in Paradise; procreation came after death (life persisting in the face of death). 
Restoration awaits Christ's return, deifying the faithful while the unrepentant experience God's perfect judgment. 
Deviating from patristic views risks heterodoxy, like cremation or nihilistic trends, undermining Christian virtues and the path to eternal life.

Dear ones, let us never get bogged down in the mud of mechanistic thinking, imagining that evolutionary processes create life from nothing -- nor that all that exists is within our event horizon.
As seekers of Truth, let us embrace the patristic vision: creation reveals God's order, the fall reveals our need for grace, and Christ is our hope.
