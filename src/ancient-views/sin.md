# Sin

!!! quote "Genesis 4:7"
    sin is crouching at your door; it desires you, but you must master it.


Sin means literally to miss the mark;
to turn away from God.

Although they are obviously related, sin is not the same as evil. Evil is the consequence of sin (being apart from God). And sin by itself is not evil.

In fact, as God explained to Cain, we must master the sin crouching at our door, master the temptations that would pull us away from God and into death.
These are the temptations Christ overcame.

Put all things in their place, even the sin crouching at your door.

!!! quote "Luke 4:7-8"
    If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.
    And Jesus answered and said unto him, **Get thee behind me, Satan**: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.

Sin in its right place is beneath us, as our worship is towards the highest ideal, God, not to the temptations that would attempt to enslave us.

These imclude our passions like anger and lust, each has its God-given purpose, and it is not to be worshipped; not made into an idol. The right place is beneath us. For we are to master our sins.

Hiding from lust and anger is to let them control you, an inversion of an explicit idol, it becomes a literal demon.

Jesus does not rebuke Satan by sending him to hell, if anything Christ affirms that the world belonged to Satan, the very world that man is to have dominion over.




Logismoi, thoughts, dark/evil thoughts -- demons checking if the door is unlocked.


There is no evil if one has perfect
 knowledge. 
All evil is born of ignorance and lies.
And the original sin was to turn away 
 from God.

Those who sin, are slaves to sin,
 which means they lack free will,
 that is, no ability to actualize
 one's will.
A slave to sin is perfectly predictable,
 a plaything of demons.
And it always ends up in the same evil.

Free will begins with choosing God,
 turning to Christ.



## Sin is weakness

Sin is weakness. This is why honesty will always overcome deceit.
