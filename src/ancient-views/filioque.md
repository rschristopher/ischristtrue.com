"and the Son"




Importantly, "proceeds from" implies a "to"

why not "proceeds from the Father to the Son"
or even "through the Son"? which is closer to the EO conception.

Christ Jesus is the way, the life, and the truth.

We are made in the image of God, and despite our fall from grace (rejecting His will and losing our "likeness" of God) we are saved only through Christ, the recipient (the "to") of the Holy Spirit, which is the Love between Father and Son, which is the relationship between the will and the word of God.

The trinity is a first principle from which logic and epistemology arise, it is how we know truth (who is the person of Christ).

like most philosophical or theological controversies, it can only be resolved by Christ Jesus, without whom we lose an epistemic relationship with the transcendent. That is, we cannot know anything without a mediator, who on one hand must be the Spirit of Truth, and likewise be man, that is, the Spirit of Truth must relate to us as both God (uncreated and infinite) and man (created and finite).
The answer to our most fundamental questions is the trinity, which we can only know through Christ Jesus.
