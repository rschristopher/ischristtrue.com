# Cosmology 

In our modern usage, cosmology is the study of the universe in terms of time and space. This is a secular view that presupposes time and space as first principles, as well as reason, logic, truth, and so on.

The more accurate etymology of cosmology is *kosmos* as in the natural order of the universe (as opposed to *chaos*) and *logia* the divine word. That is, the word or story of the natural order of the universe.
