# Cosmology

Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God
Have mercy on me, a sinner

Protect me from the evil one.
Enlighten my mind and my heart so that your wisdom may be revealed and articulated, all for your glory.

In modern usage, *cosmology* is the study of the universe in terms of time and space. This is a secular view that presupposes *time*, *space*, *reason*, *logic*, and *knowledge* as first principles. As postmodernism reveals, such secular cosmology is a cascade of unquestioned presuppositions that crumble under scrutiny, yielding absurdity. 

The word *cosmology*, however, derives from *cosmos* -- the natural order of the universe, the opposite of *chaos* -- and *logia*, the divine word or story. Thus, the ancient and truer meaning of *cosmology* is non-secular: it is the divine story of the order of the universe, with the triune God as the first principle from which all transcendent categories arise.

!!! quote "John 1:1-3"
    In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.

## Ancient Models

It is difficult, if not impossible, to understand ancient cosmological models through our modern lens. With a beam in our eye, we expect geographic maps with fixed, mechanistic scales of distance, but instead we find esoteric symbolism -- trees, turtles, dragons, a heavenly realm above a worldly "middle" realm, and an underworld of the dead.

???+ example "The Spheres between Heaven and Hell"
    ![Spheres between Heaven and Hell](/images/spheres-heaven-hell.jpg)

???+ example "The Planisphere"
    ![Planisphere](/images/planisphere.jpg)

???+ example "The Egyptian Cosmos"
    ![Egyptian Cosmos](/images/egyptian.jpg)

The conceit of our modern view is to imagine these were "scientific" models, as if ancient peoples believed in their literal geography rather than as theological maps of consciousness. Every civilization independently created such maps, and even today we conceive the world in similar terms: spheres of influence and behavior, a heavenly world above (aspirations, beauty, life), and a demonic underworld (fears, suffering, death). 

All cosmological models, ancient and modern, attempt to map a heavenly precosmogonic origin and an underworld of death. Whether intentional or not, these elements inevitably manifest.

???+ example "The Modern Cosmos"
    ![Modern Cosmos](/images/modern-cosmos.jpg)

Truth is, no one *ever* believed these were geographic maps of physical terrain. The Romans and Pharisees understood the claim that heaven and earth met at Christ’s cross -- they disagreed but grasped it far better than we do -- and no one thought this was because the cross was physically tall or that heaven began at a certain elevation. Ancient cosmology is the living story of the ordering of the created universe, and the Scriptures are the ancient Christian cosmology, with symbolic maps as aids to understanding.

!!! quote "Colossians 1:16-17"
    For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

## Biblical Cosmology

The Biblical canon presents a grand story of origin, sin, death, hope, prophecy, and redemption -- our story, the only cosmology from which morality and truth can be objectively known. Below is the chronological order of Scripture, reflecting the ancient Christian cosmology as a foundation for understanding God’s divine order. These dates are approximate, not to be taken in a modern reductionist sense, but as a holistic framework pointing to the eternal truth of Christ.

!!! warning "These are approximate years based on the ordering of Scripture -- not to be taken literally in a modern reductionist view, but understood holistically as the origin of our modern understanding."

## Precosmogonic Age

!!! info "Before Time"
    It is impossible to discuss time before time rationally. What we call *time* did not exist before creation. God is eternal, encompassing the three persons of the Trinity -- Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This omniscient and omnipotent being is eternal: His will (the Father), His word (the Son), and His love (the Holy Spirit) are one. Before creation, there was God's will, word, and love -- the first principle from which time, space, reason, and all creation (visible and invisible) emerge.

* ~Before Time  
  In the Beginning was the Word, John 1

## Edenic Age

!!! info "Walking with God"
    The Edenic age was man walking with God, ending with the fall and exile from Eden. This age marks a radical cosmological shift, introducing death through sin. Before the fall, there was no death, and thus no evolution, which is life striving in the face of death.

* ~4000 BC  
  The Creation, Genesis 1  
  The Garden of Eden, Genesis 2  
  The Fall of Man, Genesis 3

!!! quote "Genesis 2:16-17"
    And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.




---

## Antediluvian Age

!!! info "Sons of God and Nephilim"
    This age reflects the consequences of the fall -- the first rebellion against God. Sin entered human hearts, leading to Cain’s murder of Abel (the second rebellion). Humans lived for centuries, and the sons of God (angels) sinned by taking human wives, producing the Nephilim. Only Enoch and later Noah walked with God.

* ~3000 BC  
  Cain kills Abel, Genesis 4  
  From Adam to Noah, Genesis 5

!!! quote "Genesis 6:1-2"
    And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.




---

## Noahchian Age (Flood)

!!! info "The Great Flood"
    Seeing the wickedness of man, God caused a great flood, sparing only Noah and his family. After the flood, God withdrew His Spirit from man, shortening lifespans, marking a radical cosmological shift.

* ~2500 BC  
  Wickedness Provokes God's wrath, Genesis 6  
  The Great Flood, Genesis 7  
  The Flood Subsides, Genesis 8  
  Covenant of the Rainbow, Genesis 9  
  Shem, Ham and Japheth, Genesis 10

!!! quote "Genesis 6:5"
    And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.




---

## Babel (Rebellion)

!!! info "Rebellion of Babel"
    After the flood, man’s final cosmological rebellion occurred. Speaking a unified divine language, Noah’s descendants defied God’s command to populate the earth, building a city and tower to reach heaven. God scattered them, confused their language, and subjected them to principalities and dark powers -- false gods and devils.

* ~2100 BC  
  The Tower of Babel, Genesis 11

!!! quote "Genesis 11:6-7"
    And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.

## Abrahamic Age

!!! info "Covenantal Age"
    In this age, man is in a lowly state, subject to false gods and confused languages, yet hope begins with Abraham, the father of God’s chosen people, blessed by Melchizedek, priest of the most high God.

## Ezraitic Age

!!! info "Second Temple Period"
    This age begins with the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, the destruction of Solomon’s Temple, and the loss of Judean independence. Marked by the cessation of prophecy, a growing Jewish diaspora, and synthesis with Roman legalism and Greek philosophy, it prepares the world for the Messiah.

## Messianic Age

!!! info "Prophecy Fulfilled"
    This is our current age, where the prophesied Messiah, Christ Jesus, the God-man, has come. The cosmology shifts radically: God’s law is written on human hearts, and Christ rules in the midst of His enemies. This age will end with Christ’s second coming, the final judgment, and the defeat of death itself.
