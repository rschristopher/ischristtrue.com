# Order from Chaos

Dao, Daoism

yin yang


order, dry land, tyrant father

chaos, water, devouring mother


Leviathan and Behemoth

The entirety of the archetypal system is laid out here, but most fascinating, it is not a first principle. These are created effects, and in their fallen form we have the devouring mother and the tyrannical father.

In their right balance we supposedly get the loving mother and wise father, the zone of proximal development, one foot in chaos and one foot in order.
But this presupposes a higher principle, one of "you" as a rational agent that can put a foot in order or chaos -- in reality we're thrust into one or the other for reasons somewhat beyond the moment.
