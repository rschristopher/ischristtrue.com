Isaiah

Deutero-Isaiah



!!! quote "Isaiah 6:10"
    “Make the heart of this people dull, And their ears heavy, And shut their eyes; Lest they see with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And return and be healed.”

!!! quote "Isaiah 53:1"
    Who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?

The conjecture of Deutero-Isaiah is that these were written centuries apart and by different authors.


!!! quote “John 12:37-41”
    But although He had done so many signs before them, they did not believe in Him, that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke:
    
    “Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”
    
    Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:
    
    “He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, Lest they should see with their eyes, Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, So that I should heal them.”
    
    These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.


Thr gospel of John confirms it was the same Isaiah, aa he quotes from Isaiah 6 and from Isaiah 53.

"Textual criticism" that yields wild speculations based on no evidence should be called out as heresy.

The argumeny is essentially that the "tone" of the earlier sections of Isaiah are different than the later sections.
And that rather than prophecy about exile in Babylon, it must have been written during exile. But why stop there? Isaiah 53 makes a clear prophecy with a unique "tone" that is clearly referring to Christ. Why not claim a third Isaiah that wrote about Christ?

Perhaps the reason moderm scholars don't go that far is because the evidence is against them. There are copies of Isaiah centuries before before Christ.

And importantly there are no ancient copies of Isaiah that stopped at Isaiah 39, which would be an abrupt and awkward stopping place.
The [oldest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Scroll) surviving copy of Isaiah is from the dead sea scrolls and it includes the entirety of what today is Isaiah 1 through 66.
There was no seperation between Isaiah 39 and 40, in fact, ancient commentaries from the early church fathers make it clear that Isaiah is to be understood holistically and not in sections with different audiences specific to different time periods.

Truth is Christ, not the heretic musings and "textual criticism" from anti-Christian scholars.
