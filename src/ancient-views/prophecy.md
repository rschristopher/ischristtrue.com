## Major Prophets






### Isaiah


Isaiah was a prophet in the 8th century BC, specifically around 739 BC through 701 BC.
And, like the scriptures overall, the *book of Isaiah* is best understood in unity and not necessarily in discrete parts.
It is a fractal structure with multiple layers of linear story telling weaved together.
There are many repeated prophetic themes that apply both to a specific historical context
 while simultaneously applying to future prophecy including the last judgment.


!!! quote "Isaiah 1:2 ... 66:23-24"
    Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: "I have nourished and brought up children, And they have rebelled against Me"

    ...

    "And it shall come to pass That from one New Moon to another, And from one Sabbath to another, All flesh shall come to worship before Me," says the LORD.
    "And they shall go forth and look Upon the corpses of the men Who have transgressed against Me. For their worm does not die, And their fire is not quenched. They shall be an abhorrence to all flesh." 



Isaiah tells of the beginning of his prophetic mission in this extraordinary event:

!!! quote "Isaiah 6:1-8"
    In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple. Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one cried to another and said: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; The whole earth is full of His glory!” And the posts of the door were shaken by the voice of him who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke.
    
    So I said: "Woe is me, for I am undone!
    Because I am a man of unclean lips,
    And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips;
    For my eyes have seen the King,
    The Lord of hosts.”
    
    Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a live coal which he had taken with the tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth with it, and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; Your iniquity is taken away, And your sin purged.”

    Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying:
    “Whom shall I send,
    And who will go for Us?”
    
    Then I said, “Here am I! Send me.”


The person Isaiah sees on the throne is the pre-incarnate Jesus Christ, the Word of God.
And the coal offered by the seraphim is a foreshadowing of the Eucharist.
The bread and wine, the body and blood of Christ, are as the live coal carried by the seraphim that purges sin.
This is why, in orthodox churches after each communion, the priest repeats these prophetic words from Isaiah:

> Behold this hath touched thy lips, and taketh away all thine iniquities and purgeth all thy sins

Additionally, and as was the case with many of the prophets, speaking truth angered those in power and Isaiah was martyred.
In Jewish tradition, and at the time of Christ during the [second temple period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple_period),
 it was understood that Isaiah had been sawn in half by King Manasseh.

!!! quote "Hebrews 11:37-38"
    They were stoned, they were sawn in two, were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented— of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, in dens and caves of the earth.





#### Authorship

There are modern theories that insist Isaiah was written by multiple authors across several centuries.
For example, the so-called *deutero-Isaiah* (*second* Isaiah) theory holds that Isaiah 1-39 was written separately from Isaiah 40-66,
 and there's even a *trito-Isaiah* theory suggesting that Isaiah 56-66 is from a 3rd author.

Importantly, there's no evidence for multiple authorship and this is entirely a modern speculation based on "textual criticism",
 which is to suggest that there's a different writing style in these sections.
Let's examine two passages from these different "styles":

!!! quote "Isaiah 6:10 ... Isaiah 53:1"
    “Make the heart of this people dull, And their ears heavy, 
    And shut their eyes; Lest they see with their eyes, And hear with their ears, 
    And understand with their heart, And return and be healed.”

    ... 
    
    Who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?

The conjecture is that these were written centuries apart and by different authors.
However, this contradicts the witness of scripture and of tradition.

!!! quote "John 12:37-41"
    But although He had done so many signs before them, they did not believe in Him, that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke:
    
    *“Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”*
    
    Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:
    
    *“He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, Lest they should see with their eyes, Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, So that I should heal them."*
    
    These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.


Thr gospel of John confirms it was the same Isaiah, as he quotes from what we call Isaiah 6 and from Isaiah 53, and John connects them with "because Isaiah said again", referring clearly to the same person and not the "book of Isaiah".

!!! warning "**Textual criticism** that yields wild speculations based on no evidence is likely pointing towards heresy."

To be clear, there is no evidence and only a modern interpretation of Isaiah to back the notion that there were multiple authors.
The argument is essentially that the "tone" of the earlier sections of Isaiah are different than the later sections, which doesn't hold up under scrutiny as earlier sections of Isaiah also use the same prophetic tone, such as in Isaiah 6.
And this theory also suggests that because Isaiah 40-55 speaks specifically about exile in Babylon, it must have been written during that exile. 
However this assumes that all of the chapters after Isaiah 39 were written to an audience in exile under Babylon.

However, Isaiah 53 makes a clear prophecy with a unique "tone" that is clearly referring to Christ,
 and it refers to Christ as if those events had already happened.
Christ did not arise and ascend during Babylonian exile. 
The audience for these sections of Isaiah is clearly not specific to Babylonian exile.

Importantly, there are no ancient copies of Isaiah that stopped at Isaiah 39, which would be an abrupt and awkward stopping place in any age.
The evidence points to the contrary, that what we call Isaiah 40-66 was present during the life of the prophet Isaiah.
The [oldest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Scroll) surviving copy of Isaiah is from the dead sea scrolls and it includes the entirety of what today is Isaiah 1 through 66.
There was no seperation between Isaiah 39 and 40, in fact, the partitioning that existed connected 39 and 40 as if they were in the same section
 (which a competent "textual critic" would notice by even a cursory read). 

Ancient commentaries from the early church fathers make it clear that Isaiah is to be understood holistically
 and not in piecemeal with different audiences specific to different time periods.

Why would this matter? And why would it be heretical?

Breaking Isaiah into sections forces a context that is otherwise not present;
 it forces us to imagine that Israel before the Babylonian exile had no access to Isaiah 40-66,
 which significantly narrows the scope of Isaiah 1-39 (where the pre-incarnate Christ is introduced).
By this "textual criticism", the prophecied figure of Christ in Isaiah 53 was only made in the narrow context to Israel living under Babylonian exile.
This is intentionally pointing away from Christ,
 removing Christ from the first half of Isaiah, which can be refuted by Christ's own words in John 12:37-41.

Truth is Christ Jesus, the alpha and the omega, not the heretic musings and "textual criticism" from scholars under the sway of the spirit of antichrist.





#### Old Covenant

Much of the Book of Isaiah is prophecies concerning the Davidic and Ezraitic ages, that is, Israel's continuous cycle of salvation and exile.
It is part of larger narrative theme that started in Genesis and is fulfilled in the person of Christ.
Specifically it is concerning God's mercy and man's rebellion, culminating in man's salvation through God's perfect love for mankind.

!!! quote "Isaiah 44:2-3 ... 44:24"
    Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.
    For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring

    ...
    
    Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself.

You, through His redemption, are an icon of God, not molten things man-made, redeemer must be God, not created.

* 45 Cyrus the annointed (2 Chronicles 36:22-23), ruin Babylon, second temple shall be built... Dead idols vs Living God, Fall of Babylon








#### New Covenant, Messiah

Prophecies concerning the messiah, the suffering servant and His life and the following messianic age.

!!! quote "Isaiah 7:14"
    Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel.


!!! quote "Isaiah 9:6-7"
    For unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is given; And the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His government and peace There will be no end, Upon the throne of David and over His kingdom, To order it and establish it with judgment and justice From that time forward, even forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.


Root of Jesse

!!! quote "Isaiah 11:1-2"
    And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD

Jesse is David's father, the savior will come from the lineage of David and sit eternally on the throne of David.

Rod and staff, of a king, of a shepherd

* 32 righteous king is coming, and princes to rule ... do not be complacent but turn to the Lord


* 40-49 comfort..

!!! quote "Isaiah 40:1 ... 49:13"
    "Comfort, yes, comfort My people!"

    ...

    Sing, O heavens! Be joyful, O earth! And break out in singing, O mountains! For the LORD has comforted His people, And will have mercy on His afflicted.

hope and comfort during future (Babylonian) exile, prophecy about John the Baptist, and the coming of the word/Logos, the redeemer, the preincarnate Logos.
Warning against idols, against man-made images, deceit from false gods (fallen spirits), contrasted with the true icon of God in the redeemer, the coming savior (in whom My soul delights), who is God.



* 43 

!!! quote "Isaiah 43:10-13"
    "You are My witnesses,” declares the LORD, “and My servant whom I have chosen, so that you may consider and believe Me and understand that I am He. 
    Before Me no god was formed, and after Me none will come.
    
    I, yes I, am the LORD, and there is no Savior but Me. I alone decreed and saved and proclaimed— I, and not some foreign god among you. So you are My witnesses,” declares the LORD, “that I am God.
    Even from eternity I am He, and none can deliver out of My hand. When I act, who can reverse it?”

!!! quote "Isaiah 45:19"
    I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.

* 46 Salvation must be from God, for who else can save?

!!! quote "Isaiah 46:10-13"
    Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:
    
    Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.
    
    Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from righteousness:
    I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.

Yet salvation here is not a concept, but a person, a person who will overcome death, a person who must necessarily be the word of God.

* 47 Warning to Babylon 

!!! quote "Isaiah 47:13-15"
    Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.
    Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.
    
    Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.




* 48 the pre-incarnate Logos reveals His plans for redemption of mam, for His own sake! And the trinity is revealed!!

!!! quote "Isaiah 48:16"
    "Come near to Me, hear this: I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; From the time that it was, I was there. And now the Lord GOD and His Spirit Have sent Me."


The servant, redeemer, savior, who necessarily is God yet also born of His mother -- will redeem Israel AND be the light to the gentiles.

!!! quote "Isaiah 49:6"
    Indeed He says, "It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant To raise up the tribes of Jacob, And to restore the preserved ones of Israel; I will also give You as a light to the Gentiles, That You should be My salvation to the ends of the earth."
    

And the Lord will not forget His people. He will not forget Israel.

* 50-55 Servant of the Lord, who is the incarnate Logos, the word of God, speaking to Isaiah as the Lord God, the pre-incarnate Logos.

!!! quote "Isaiah 50:6"
    I gave My back to those who struck Me, And My cheeks to those who plucked out the beard; I did not hide My face from shame and spitting.

The servant speaks as both obediant and with complete authority, and often in the past tense.

!!! quote "Isaiah 51:6"
    Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.

Fear only the Lord God.

The suffering servant, an "offering for sim".

!!! quote "Isaiah 52:13-15"
    Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men: So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.

The trinity, the Lord's Servant is necessarily Christ Jesus...

!!! quote "Isaiah 53:5"
    But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

Importantly, Isaiah's prophecies are spoken by the Lord, who is the suffering servant on the throne.
He is introduced early on and is speaking to Isaiah throughout.
And we see many parallels in the early chapters that are repeated in later chapters, often representing the last judgment. For example:

!!! quote "Isaiah 6:6-7 ... Isaiah 54:16"
    Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.

    ...
    
    Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.



New covenant, everlasting covenant of peace...


* 55 The messianic age, an invitation to salvation and eternal life

* 56-66 final judgment and salvation

* 56 Salvation for the gentiles.
The watchmmen are blind... the created spirits assigned dominion are blinded and we (hunans) can go to Him

* 57 Metciful men are taken away from evil. Righteous by works suffer without hope. Your idols will fall. Fear only the Lord. Trust only in the Lord.

The humble will be saved, and healed.
The wicked will have no peace.


* 58 Fasting that pleases God. Keep the Sabath, delight the Lord.

!!! quote "Isaiah 63:3"
    “I have trodden the winepress alone, And from the peoples no one was with Me. For I have trodden them in My anger, And trampled them in My fury; Their blood is sprinkled upon My garments, And I have stained all My robes.

!!! quote "Revelation 19:15"
    And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.

    “The sun shall no longer be your light by day, Nor for brightness shall the moon give light to you; But the Lord will be to you an everlasting light, And your God your glory. Your sun shall no longer go down, Nor shall your moon withdraw itself; For the Lord will be your everlasting light, And the days of your mourning shall be ended. Also your people shall all be righteous; They shall inherit the land forever, The branch of My planting, The work of My hands, That I may be glorified. A little one shall become a thousand, And a small one a strong nation. I, the Lord, will hasten it in its time.”


* 61 Everlasting covenant... righteousness and praise before all nations.



* 62

!!! quote "Isaiah 62:2"
    The Gentiles shall see your righteousness, And all kings your glory. You shall be called by a new name, Which the mouth of the Lord will name.


!!! quote "Matthew 1:21"
    And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.”
