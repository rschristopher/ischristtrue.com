<!--

Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God
Have mercy on me, a sinner

Guide me Lord
That I may articulate your wisdom and the words of prophecy.
Grant me wisdom, eyes to see, ears to hear; that I may know the Spirit of Truth that is in these books; that your words of truth may reach me.
May these pages guide towards your glory, that I may seek refuge and shelter, that I may be saved, that I may love you Lord, as you have loved me despite my unworthiness.

Root of Jesse

!!! quote "Isaiah 11:1-2"
    And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD

Jesse is David's father, the savior will come from the lineage of David and sit eternally on the throne of David.

Rod and staff, of a king, of a shepherd


8th century BC

A prophetic text that can only be understood in unity and never in parts.

!!! quote "Isaiah 1:2 ... 66:23-24"
    Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: "I have nourished and brought up children, And they have rebelled against Me"

    ...

    "And it shall come to pass That from one New Moon to another, And from one Sabbath to another, All flesh shall come to worship before Me," says the LORD.
    "And they shall go forth and look Upon the corpses of the men Who have transgressed against Me. For their worm does not die, And their fire is not quenched. They shall be an abhorrence to all flesh." 



1-12 

13-27 

28-33 final judgment and hell

break in Great Isaiah Scroll

34-35 ...judgment and redemption of the nations

36-39 retelling of Hezekaiah and the fall and redemption of Judea to Assyria and prophecied Babylonian exile, 2 Kings 18-20 and 2 Chronicles 29-32.

40-49 

!!! quote "Isaiah 40:1 ... 49:13"
    "Comfort, yes, comfort My people!"

    ...

    Sing, O heavens! Be joyful, O earth! And break out in singing, O mountains! For the LORD has comforted His people, And will have mercy on His afflicted.

hope and comfort during future (Babylonian) exile, prophecy about John the Baptist, and the coming of the word/Logos, the redeemer, the preincarnate Logos.
Warning against idols, against man-made images, deceit from false gods (fallen spirits), contrasted with the true icon of God in the redeemer, the coming savior (in whom My soul delights), who is God.
43!!!
The LORD formed you from the womb. You, through His redemption, are an icon of God, not molten things man-made, redeemer must be God made.
Cyrus the annointed (2 Chronicles 36:22-23), ruin Babylon, second temple shall be built...
Dead idols vs Living God
Fall of Babylon
48 the pre-incarnate Logos reveals His plans for redemption of mam, for His own sake!
And the trinity is revealed!!

!!! quote "Isaiah 48:16"
    "Come near to Me, hear this: I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; From the time that it was, I was there. And now the Lord GOD and His Spirit Have sent Me."


The servant, redeemer, savior, who necessarily is God yet also born of His mother -- will redeem Israel AND be the light to the gentiles.

!!! quote "Isaiah 49:6"
    Indeed He says, "It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant To raise up the tribes of Jacob, And to restore the preserved ones of Israel; I will also give You as a light to the Gentiles, That You should be My salvation to the ends of the earth."
    

And the Lord will not forget His people. He will not forget Israel.



50-55 
Servant of the Lord

!!! quote "Isaiah 50:6"
    I gave My back to those who struck Me, And My cheeks to those who plucked out the beard; I did not hide My face from shame and spitting.


Fear only the Lord.

The trinity, the Lord's Servant is necessarily Christ Jesus...

!!! quote "Isaiah 53:5"
    But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

Importantly, Isaiah's prophecies are recorded from the Lord, the suffering servant on the throne.
He is introduced early on and is recorded by Isaiah throughout.
And we see many parallels in the early chapters that are repeated in later chapters representing the last judgment. For example:

!!! quote "Isaiah 6:6-7 ... Isaiah 54:16"
    Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.

    ...
    
    Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.

In many orthodox churches, after each communion with the Eucharist, the priest repeats the words from prophecy:

> Behold this hath touched thy lips, and taketh away all thine iniquities and purgeth all thy sins

The bread and wine, the body and blood of Christ, are as the live coal carried by a seraphim that purges sin.

New covenant, everlasting covenant of peace...








56-66 final judgment and salvation











Deutero-Isaiah

Lets comsider the following two passages from "proto-Isaiah" and one from "deutero-Isaiah":

!!! quote "Isaiah 6:10 ... Isaiah 53:1"
    “Make the heart of this people dull, And their ears heavy, And shut their eyes; Lest they see with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And return and be healed.”

    ... 
    
    Who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?

The conjecture of Deutero-Isaiah is that these were written centuries apart and by different authors.
However, this contradicts the witness of scripture and of tradition.


!!! quote "John 12:37-41"
    But although He had done so many signs before them, they did not believe in Him, that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke:
    
    *“Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”*
    
    Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:
    
    *“He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, Lest they should see with their eyes, Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, So that I should heal them."*
    
    These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.


Thr gospel of John confirms it was the same Isaiah, as he quotes from Isaiah 6 and from Isaiah 53, and connects them with "because Isaiah said again", referring clearly to the person and not the "book of Isaiah".

"Textual criticism" that yields wild speculations based on no evidence should be called out as heresy.

To be clear, there is no evidence and only "textual criticism" and a modern interpretation of Isaiah to back the notion that there are multiple authors.
The argument is essentially that the "tone" of the earlier sections of Isaiah are different than the later sections, which doesn't hold up under scrutiny as earlier sections of Isaiah also use the same prophetic tone, such as in Isaiah 6.
And because Isaiah 40-55 speaks specifically about exile in Babylon, it must have been written during that exile. 
However this assumes that all of the chapters after Isaiah 39 were written to an audience in exile under Babylon. 
Isaiah 53 makes a clear prophecy with a unique "tone" that is clearly referring to Christ, and it refers to this "suffering servant" as if it had already happened. Christ did not arise or ascend during Babylonian exile. 
The audience for these sections of Isaiah is not specific to Babylonian exile.
Very clearly the audience of Isaiah is universal.

Imagine an Israelite in the 2nd century BC reading these sections; it would be as difficult to understand as modern day interpretations of the Book of Revelation. 
Isaiah is clearly referring to an unfulfilled prophecy, because at that point Israel was no longer under Babylonian rule, but the events in "Deutero Isaiah" had not yet occurred.

Importantly there are no ancient copies of Isaiah that stopped at Isaiah 39, which would be an abrupt and awkward stopping place in any age.
The evidence points to the contrary, that what we call Isaiah 40-66 was present during the life of the prophet Isaiah.
The [oldest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Scroll) surviving copy of Isaiah is from the dead sea scrolls and it includes the entirety of what today is Isaiah 1 through 66.
There was no seperation between Isaiah 39 and 40, in fact, the partitioning that existed connected 39 and 40 as if they were in the same section. 

Ancient commentaries from the early church fathers make it clear that Isaiah is to be understood holistically and not in piecemeal with different audiences specific to different time periods.

Why would this matter?

Breaking Isaiah into sections forces a context that is otherwise not present; it forces us to imagine that Israel before the Babylonian exile had no access to Isaiah 40-66, which significantly narrows the scope of Isaiah 1-39, specifically by removing Christ.
By this "textual criticism", the prophecied figure of Christ in Isaiah 53 was only made in the narrow context to Israel living under Babylonian exile.
This is intentionally pointing away from Christ, removing Christ from the first half of Isaiah, which can be refuted by Christ's own words in John 12:37-41.

Truth is Christ, the alpha and the omega, not the heretic musings and "textual criticism" from scholars under the sway of the spirit of antichrist.
