# Logos

The word, plural is *logoi*





## Logia

Logia is the plural form of  *logion* which typically refers to divinely inspired words or stories. 
*Logia* was used to reference the divinely inspired word of God.


## -ology

While our [modern views](../modern-views/index.md) tell us that words ending in -ology refer to "the study of",
 the origin is of course from *Logia* and refers to stories or words (usually from God).
This can be demonstrated by the fact many -ology suffix words make no reference to "study", e.g.,

!!! question "the study of?"
    * trilogy -- the study of 3?
    * technology -- the study of techne?
    * apology -- the study of what exactly?

None of these make sense, however, if we recognize the ancient root *-logia* then these all make a lot more sense, e.g.,

!!! info "Logia suffix"
    * trilogy -- 3 stories
    * technology -- techne (art, skill, technique) stories
    * apology -- from/of the word, e.g., Christian apologetics
    
    We can even get a better sese  of the supposed "study of" scholastic disciplines,
    
    * cosmology -- the universe (order) story
    * geology -- the ground/soil story
    * eschatology -- the end story
    * etymology -- the original meaning of words

The ancient understanding of *Logia* dispels much of the confusion found in the modern view.
Specifically because "study of" is a vain attempt to remove God and His revelatory truth, replacing it with man making a "study of" nature as if man were God.
Once again, echoes of that snake in the garden,

> Ye shall be as gods
