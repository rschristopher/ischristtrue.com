# Iconoclasm

idols versus icons

breaking of icons

iconoclasts are themselves evidence of ancient veneration of icons.


symbols and types, prototype, archetype


## Anathema!

iconoclasts destroy what they see as graven images, idols -- but let us not grant piety to destruction of what are clearly not idols. 

In fact, the seventh ecumenical council did not mince words in the pronouncement of anathemas to the iconoclasts.

Humans venerate and praise, and they are to worship only God.

Today, while most iconoclastic protestants would never adorn their church with iconography, they do not question a nativity scene in their front yard during Christmas.
Should we destroy nativity scenes wherever we see them?
Is this not the behavior of the adversary?

We ought not condone such reprehensible behavior.

Venerating icons is like venerating the words of scripture. Both icons and scripture are symbols pointing us to God, helping and guiding us towards Christ Jesus.

Worshipping icons would be wrong, and should be condemned as heretical wherever such evil is found.
And likewise, conflating icons with idol worship should similarly be condemned.
Imagine burning Bibles because someone thought people were worshipping Bibles.
If you can understand that you're not worshipping a Bible then you can understand that icon veneration is not idol worship.

A very simple test, icons are often fungible, idols are not and cannot be fungible. What we honor is not what we worship. For example, you may have a particular family Bible with deep sentimental value, but you certainly don't worship it or value it over God.





## Idols

!!! quote "Exodus 20:4-5"
    Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: 
    Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me


!!! quote "Leviticus 19:4"
    Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.



!!! quote "1 Corinthians 10:14-22"
    Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry. 
    I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. 
    The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? 
    For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread. 
    
    Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar? 
    What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? 
    But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. 
    Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils. 
    Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?


!!! quote "Colossians 3:2-8"
    Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. 
    For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 
    When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
    
    Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 
    
    For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 
    In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 
    But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.



!!! quote "1 John 5:19-21"
    And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. 
    And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.
    
    Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.











## Icons

!!! quote "Exodus 25:18-21"
    And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat. 
    And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof. 
    And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be. 
    And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.


!!! quote "Exodus 26:1"
    Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.


!!! quote "1 Kings 6:23-28"
    And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high. 
    And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits. 
    And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size. 
    The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub. 
    And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. 
    And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.



!!! quote "Ezekiel 41:18-19"
    And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces; 
    So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about.








## Relationship between Idol and Icon

What we worship determines what we venerate.
We do not, and can not, choose what we venerate. What we venerate is a merely consequence of what we worship.

If we worship money (mammon) then we will venerate sources and symbols of wealth.
If we worship ourselves then we will venerate images of ourselves (as is so common on social media today).
If we worship nothing, we will venerate symbols of nothingness, such as postmodern philosophy, moral relativism, fashion trends, and absurdism.
If we worship our career, we will venerate symbols of our career status, business cards, conferences, and so forth.

Importantly, if we worship God, we will venerate the Saints that inspire in us a deeper sense of worship.
If we worship Christ, then we will venerate His mother who birthed the God-man.
And if we worship the one true God, then we will venerate the symbols of the one true God, including scripture.

If, on the other hand, we do not feel any respect or honor to the Saints, or to the Theotokos, or to the scriptures, then it is not God that we worship.
We all worship something, and our actions through what we venerate, will reveal what it is we are worshipping.







## Christ as Icon


The most interesting example of an icon is the person of Christ Jesus, that through Him we may look upon the face of the Father.


!!! quote "John 14:9"
    Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?






!!! quote "1 John 1:1-2"
    That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; 
    (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us)



!!! quote "Hebrews 1:3"
    Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;


εἰκὼν (eikōn)


!!! quote "Colossians 1:15"
    ὅς ἐστιν **εἰκὼν** τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ἀοράτου, πρωτότοκος πάσης κτίσεως,
    
    He is the **image** of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.


!!! quote "2 Corinthians 4:4"
    In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.

Image of God, literally icon of God.

!!! quote "Colossians 3:9-10"
    Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; 
    And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him



To be clear, just as Moses beheld God in the Tabernacle, Christ has condescended down to us such that we all may behold God upon this world.
This is a radical cosmological shift..


!!! quote "2 Corinthians 4:16-18"
    For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. 
    For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; 
    While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.
