# Fall from Grace

Modern Christians may talk of *the fall* -- but in Genesis there is not one but three falls; three distinct rebellions against God, each dramatically changing the nature of man and creation.

## 1. Exile from Eden

> Ye shall be as Gods

The entire cosmos changed. A seraphim, one of the highest of the heavenly hosts, rebelled against God along with man. Death now exists, and as such natural laws and a striving of life in the face of death (what we call *evolution*).


## 2. The Great Flood

It is here that the Lord withdrew His spirit such that it will no longer strive with man. The very nature of man and the cosmology of creation further changes here.

!!! quote "Genesis 6:3-8"
    And the Lord said, “My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for he is indeed flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.” There were giants on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.

    Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. So the Lord said, “I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them.” But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

These giants, the Nephilim, are the children of the sons of God (the heavenly hosts) and the daughters of men. And note that this was not the cause of the flood, but rather it was the continuous evil of man that was the cause of the flood. And it's indicated that the Nephilim still exist after the flood,

> There were giants on the earth in those days, *and also afterward*

Like the other rebellions, this one is ongoing. There were spirits, [angels](angels-demons.md), watchers, that failed at their God-given duties and rebelled against the almighty. And to this day there are men engaged in this ongoing rebellion, as well as Nephilim.

And the spirits of dead Nephilim are what we refer to today as [demons](angels-demoms.md). From this point forward, men no longer live for centuries, and there are demons in the world.



## 3. Tower of Babel

!!! quote "Genesis 11:1-9
    Now the whole earth had one language and one speech. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there. Then they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They had brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar. And they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.”
    
    But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. And the Lord said, “Indeed the people are one and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do; now nothing that they propose to do will be withheld from them. Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.” So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they ceased building the city. Therefore its name is called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth; and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.

This rebellion is multifaceted, the descendants of Noah ignored the command from the Lord to be fruitful and multiply over the face of th earth.
And they lose the divine tongue, the original language spoken by Adam to God, a language that was never confused and was so powerful that,

> nothing that they propose to do will be withheld from them

This moment further changes cosmology, splitting up the world into nations, each with spirits, the heavenly hosts, as overseers. Principalities and Dominions are now roles fulfilled by the heavenly hosts who become the pagan gods of the old and new testament.

This exacerbates the problems from the second ongoing rebellion, such that it is not just watchers but now pagan gods, and men become the playthings of these territorial spirits in an ever increasing demon haunted world.



# Redemption

Similar to the fall there is not one but three stages of redemption to undo the previous three rebellions, restoring man for the purpose for which we were created.

## 1. Israel

The earth was divided amongst the heavenly hosts, with varying degrees of rebellion from God. Yet with Israel, the one true God, the Lord of Spirits descends into the world.

!!! quote "Psalm 82"
    God stands in the congregation of the mighty; He judges among the gods. How long will you judge unjustly, And show partiality to the wicked? Selah
    
    Defend the poor and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy; Free them from the hand of the wicked.
    
    They do not know, nor do they understand; They walk about in darkness; All the foundations of the earth are unstable.
    
    I said, “You are gods, And all of you are children of the Most High. But you shall die like men, And fall like one of the princes.”
    
    Arise, O God, judge the earth; For You shall inherit all nations.

This is one of the most fascinating sections in the Bible. Our modern view has difficulty interpreting this, but the ancient view had no issue interpreting Psalm 82. Because there were many gods, each given a territory to rule over. These are the dominions and principalities. And with Israel God now places himself directly into the world such that one nation is to become the people of the one true God. And it is from Israel's descendants that all redemption will be possible.

> For You shall inherit all nations.


2. Death and Resurrection of Christ

The harrowing of Hades, Christ overcomes death. And it is here where all of the Dominions and Principalities begin to lose their authority.

He is risen


3. Lord of Lords

!!! quote "Revelation 19:11-16
    Now I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war. His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name written that no one knew except Himself. He was clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. And the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses. Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written:
    
    KING OF KINGS AND
    LORD OF LORDS.

In the end, death is defeated, man is redeemed, and His will is done on earth as it is in heaven.
