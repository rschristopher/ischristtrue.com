# Antichrist

<!--
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God
Have mercy on me, a sinner

Protect me from the evil one.
Enlighten my mind and my heart so that your wisdom may be revealed and articulated, all for your glory.

The prophesied *antichrist* -- both a person and a spirit -- is best understood in light of Christ’s decisive victory over the demons, principalities, and powers (the fallen angels). 
Through His life, death, and resurrection, Christ bound the "strong man" (Satan), stripping him of his authority and establishing the Kingdom of God on earth. 
Yet, in the midst of Christ’s reign, the devil, though defeated, persists as a foil to the divine order, sowing the spirit of *antichrist* as his desperate countermove.

## Satan’s Defeat

!!! quote "Mark 3:27"
    No man can enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.

Before Christ, humanity languished under Satan’s dominion, enslaved by sin and death. 
The devil even boasted authority over the world’s kingdoms, offering them to Jesus during the temptation in the wilderness.

!!! quote "Luke 4:5-7"
    And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, and said to him, “To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.”

Even God’s chosen people, the Israelites, groaned under Roman rule and the diaspora, subject to Satan’s worldly powers. 
But Christ -- as God incarnate and perfect man -- shattered this dominion. 
He cast out demons, healed the sick, forgave sins, and triumphed over death itself, manifesting the Kingdom of God on earth as it is in heaven.

## Christ’s Reign

In this Messianic Age, Christ reigns supreme, even as His enemies strike his heel.

!!! quote "Psalms 110:2"
    The Lord shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion. Rule in the midst of Your enemies!

Though Satan and his legions lost their authority, their influence lingers for a time, as foretold in Daniel’s vision.

!!! quote "Daniel 7:12"
    As for the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.

Daniel’s vision describes three beasts -- a leopard, a bear, and a lion -- followed by a fourth, the serpent or great dragon. 
In Revelation, these merge into a final beast, empowered by the dragon himself.

!!! quote "Revelation 13:2"
    Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.

This final beast -- the prophesied antichrist -- emerges in the last days before judgment. 
The *spirit of antichrist* has appeared throughout history, preparing the way for a kingdom of man that opposes God’s rule.

## False Christs

Jesus warned of deceivers who would lead many astray.

!!! quote "Matthew 24:24"
    For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.

The antichrist is the antithesis of Christ -- an imitation that inverts truth itself. 
Where Christ submits wholly to the Father and offers eternal life, the antichrist exalts himself, peddling lies of a worldly kingdom that leads only to death. 
This spirit manifests in globalist ideologies, from ancient empires to modern transhumanism, where elites seek godhood through their own power.

The spirit of antichrist lures the Church away from Christ, often under the guise of compassion or progress. 
Calls to “modernize” the Church -- whether through innovations in Rome or the reformations of Protestantism -- risk aligning with this spirit, leading the flock not to Christ but to the lost sheep of the world.

## Man of Sin

The final antichrist -- the “man of sin” -- will rise not from heaven but from the earth, deceiving even the faithful.

!!! quote "2 Thessalonians 2:3"
    Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.

This figure will embody the ultimate rebellion against God, cloaked in counterfeit signs and wonders. 
Yet, discernment is possible through the lens of Christ’s truth.
