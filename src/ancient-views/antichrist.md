The prophecied person and spirit of *antichrist* should be understood in the context of fallen angels and demons, specifically in the triumph of Christ over the demons and over the principalities and powers (fallen angels).
Critically, man was under complete subjugation and dominion of Satan.
Satan tempted Christ with the worldly kingdoms, and importantly: they were his to give.

!!! quote "Luke 4;5-7"
    And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, and said to him, “To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.”

Even the Israelites were under the authority of Satan's worldly kingdoms, under Roman rule and throughout the diaspora.

It was in the life of Christ that the kingdom of God became manifest on earth and in heaven.
This was the defeat of Satan and his angels, decisively.
Christ cast out evil spirits, healed the sick, forgave sins, and most importantly, overcame death.

Christ did so as God and as man, the word of God made flesh.
And now in the Messianic Age, Christ rules in the midst of His enemies.

!!! quote "Psalms 110:2"
    The Lord shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion. Rule in the midst of Your enemies!

And as such, Satan and his legions were cast out from their authority, and like the remaining beasts from the vision of Daniel, their lives were prolonged for a time.

!!! quote "Daniel 12:12"
    As for the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.

The three beasts in the vision of Daniel were a leopard, a bear, and a lion. And the fourth beast was the serpent, the great dragon.
Contrast this with the beast in Revelation 13:

!!! quote "Revelation 13:2"
     Now the beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.

This final beast, hybrid of hybrids, is the prophecied antichrist who will come in the final days before judgment.
The spirit of antichrist has been manifest in the world many times, and all throughout history, preparing the way for his kingdom.

???+ warning "The false prophet"
    ...

Importantly, the antichrist is the complete antithesis of Christ, both an imitation and His opposite.
Christ submits with complete obedience to His father, and offers eternal life in His kingdom.
The antichrist submits to no one but himself, and offers lies of a worldly kingdom and only death.
This beast is a global totalitarianism, exactly as defined and sought by every generation of globalist "elite", such as the transhumanists seeking to make man into gods.

Always the spirit of antichrist points in the exact opposite direction of Christ.
The final antichrist, the person of antichrist, will come not from heaven but from earth.
And even God-fearing Christians will be taken in, especially at first.
