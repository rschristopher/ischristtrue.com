# Apocrypha 

We tend to misunderstand "apocryphal" and assume it means heretical or false, when in fact the ancient view fully understood that there was three categories of text: *canonical, apocryphal,* and *heretical*.
Heretical refers to texts that are false or blatantly misleading.
Canonical refers to texts that are accurate true accounts.
And apocryphal was everything in-between.

The word "apocrypha" means hidden or private, although not to be confused with "occult" which is better understood as "to be kept secret". Apoceypha referred to texts that are best read in private, whereas canonical texts are best read in public.
