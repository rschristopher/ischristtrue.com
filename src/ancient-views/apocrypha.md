# Apocrypha 

We tend to misunderstand "apocryphal" and assume it means heretical or false, when in fact the ancient view fully understood that there was three categories of text: *canonical, apocryphal,* and *heretical*.
Heretical refers to texts that are false or blatantly misleading.
Canonical refers to texts that are accurate, true, and necessary for truth.
And apocryphal was everything in-between.
In other words, apocryphal texts contain at least some truth but may be misleading or inaccurate.

The word "apocrypha" means hidden or private, not to be confused with "occult" which is better understood as "to be kept secret". 

At a time when canonical texts were read publicly, apocryphal texts were best read in private with careful discernment.
The closest we have today is the expression, "it's not for everybody".
As such, an apocryphal text was never occult per se, whereas a heretical text was possibly occult.
