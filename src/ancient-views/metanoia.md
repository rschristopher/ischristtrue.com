[Metanoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metanoia_%28theology%29)

[etymology](https://www.etymonline.com/word/metanoia)


axiom

first principles

root cause

necessarily taken on faith, for if there was a cause for a first principle, that cause would be the first principle 

!!! quote "Jonathan Swift"
    Reasoning will never make a Man correct an ill Opinion, which by Reasoning he never acquired

Or as it's usually paraphrased, 

> You Cannot Reason People Out of Something They Were Not Reasoned Into

We can see here a clear example of the enlightenment mistake, the unquestioned belief in reason itself as a first principle. To put it succinctly, ones belief in reason cannot be reasoned into (thus people will abandon reason, without a good reason).

Reason is not self justifying, and can provide no defensible epistemology, let alone an ethic. 

Faith in reason is a form of self worship, imagining ourselves as unbiased observers of an objectively knowable world and that we can reason our way to knowledge and truth.

To connect to a deeper first principle is *metanoia*. It is the revelation of a cause to what you falsely believed was the first principle. This cause will become the first principle.

And in terms of reason, from where does it arise? Where does reason come from?

And what about morality? Or even mathematics? Or beauty?

Are these all first principles that we must accept on faith? Or is there a deeper and unifying first principle? A first principle that when accepted will be a moment of metanoia.
