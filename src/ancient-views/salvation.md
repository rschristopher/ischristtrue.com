# Salvation

not legalistic

it is a process, a healing

becoming like Christ (theosis)



!!! quote "The Theotokos in a vision to Elder Anthimos"
    Those who struggle for Christ
    not only have a great reward,
    but even their sweat will be considered as the blood of martyrs on the Day of Judgment 

!!! quote "Blessed Synkletike"
    Those who begin life in God encounter much toil and suffering in the beginning; afterwards they find indescribable joy.
