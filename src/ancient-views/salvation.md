# Salvation

not legalistic

it is a process, a healing

becoming like Christ (theosis)



Soteriology

The Augustinian error of sin as inherited guilt leads necessarily to heresy in both Roman Catholic and Reformed theological frameworks.

inevitably, one produces either
1. the immaculate conception, the belief that Mary was born without sin
2. nestorianism with iconoclasm, denial of Mary as the mother of God, and destroying images so as not to confront this fact.





!!! quote "The Theotokos in a vision to Elder Anthimos"
    Those who struggle for Christ
    not only have a great reward,
    but even their sweat will be considered as the blood of martyrs on the Day of Judgment 



!!! quote "Blessed Synkletike"
    Those who begin life in God encounter much toil and suffering in the beginning; afterwards they find indescribable joy.



!!! quote "St. Cyril of Jerusalem"
    Take courage, toil and strive zealously, for nothing will be lost.
    Every prayer you make, every psalm you sing, every aim, every fast is recorded.


!!! quote "Blessed Augustine"
    Do what you can and then pray that God will give you the power to do what you cannot.
