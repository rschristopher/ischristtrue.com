# Angels, Demons, and Antichrist

https://orthochristian.com/106805.html

Despite the nihilism of our modern views, many people still hold a vague belief in angels and demons. Even non-believers flirt with the idea. 
The prevalence of ghost stories within popular film and television is an indicator of how deeply this ancient idea persists.
It seems that far more people today are open to belief in angels and demons than they are to God. And as we'll see, this is no accident.


Technically, the word *angel* means a messenger of God. As such, it can best be thought of as a role. However when talking of angels we typically are not referring to a job title. We are referring to a spirit. And we think of demons as evil spirits. If we believe in God then we typically view demons as fallen angels, fallen from God's grace.

This view bears some truth despite its childlike simplicity. The gospels are filled with references to angels and demons where the angels are good, and the demons evil. Yet there's also references to other spiritual beings -- thrones, dominions, principalities. And there's references to archangels, hinting not at job titles but instead to a rank, a hierarchy.

There's references to heavenly hosts, to "sons of God", to cherubim and seraphim, and of course nephelim -- the famed giants precipitating the flood.

And most striking, there's even references to gods.
While modern Christians view the idea of other gods as fairy tales, they must ignore their own Bibles while doing so. Ancient Christians understood all these biblical references. And it remains profitable to reveal exactly what the Bible is referring to with all these passages.



Christians hear about Jesus at church but almost never a mention of demons beyond the superficial "something evil". Interestingly, the Bible references these spiritual beings as if we already know what they are. There's no explanation of angels just references in different contexts.

It seems we have three options here.

* Ignorance
* Milton's Paradise Lost
* Ancient view of the early church 



Often we imagine demons as angels who fell from God's grace. 
However, the prevelant view was that demons were the spirits of dead nephilim.

"Demon" shares the etymological root of the word *demonstrate*, much like the word "monster" is literally *to show*.

The purpose and the right place for demons is to show our sin, our fall from grace. In practical terms it is to tempt, to torment in the darkness away from the light of God.

We are made in the image and likeness of God. It is no wonder the demons hate us so.
