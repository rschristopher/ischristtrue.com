# Angels, Demons, and Antichrist


Despite the nihilism of our modern age, modern people still hold a vague belief in angels and demons. 
Even non-believers flirt with the idea. 
The prevalence of ghost stories within film and television is an indicator of how deeply this ancient idea persists.

It seems that far more people today are open to belief in angels and demons than they are to God. 
And as we'll see, this is no accident.





## Mythologies

In our modern secular view we think of *mythology* as false or make believe, like fairy tails, or at best as primitive beliefs from "less evolved civilizations".
However, *myth* simply means *story*, and the *-ology* suffix is derived from *logia* (divine word), and thus *mythology* is best thought of as "stories that unite a people into a culture" or "stories we participate in" or "stories people live by".
And if we take a sober look at ancient mythologies, we find angels and demons featured in all of them.

Technically, the word *angel* means a messenger of God. 
As such, it can best be thought of as a role, like a job title. 
However when talking of angels we typically are not referring to a job title. 
We are referring to spiritual beings. 
Angels are spiritual beings, and "demons" usually refer to evil spirits. 
If we believe in God then we typically view demons as fallen angels, fallen from God's grace.

The Bible, and the gospels in particular, are filled with references to angels and demons. 
Yet there's also references to other spiritual beings such as thrones, dominions, and principalities. 
And there's references to archangels, hinting not only to job titles but instead to a rank, a hierarchy.
Additionally, there's references to heavenly hosts, to "sons of God", to cherubim and seraphim, rephaim, and of course nephelim -- the famed *giants* precipitating the great flood.

And most striking, there's even references to other gods.
While modern Christians view the idea of mythological gods as fairy tales, they must ignore their own Bibles while doing so. 
Ancient Christians understood all of these biblical references to other gods as being created (usually fallen) spirits.

Interestingly, the Bible continually references these spiritual beings as if we already know what they are. 
There's no explanation of angels or demons or devils, and no articulated taxonomy about this hierarchy of spirits.
How are we to make sense of this?





### Paganism

The term *pagan*, like *heathen*, simply refers to religous systems outside of Judiasm and Christianity.
Paganism is commonly associated with the Greek and Roman pantheon of gods, but we can analyze the broader sense of paganism within world mythologies.
In doing so we find that the myriad of mythological gods have a lot in common.

In pagan mythologies we find identical themes: regional gods have dominion over people, where man is subordinate to these gods, worshipping these territorial gods and giving sacrifice.
The pagan gods are typically indifferent or antagonistic to humans; such that humans are nothing but the playthings of these gods.

The innovation in Judiaism is the realization (revelation) that the God most high is uncreated, and not only the creator of all, but also the source of morality, a universal morality, that good and evil are objectively knowable. As such only the God most high is to be worshipped.
Contrast this with the Roman pantheon, where the gods of conquered people were collected and worshipped.

Within pagan mythologies you'll even find stories of a great flood, lost civilizations, and even some heavenly rebellions -- although interestingly, the pagan gods all succeded in their rebellions:
Zeus overthrew his father Cronus, who had in turn castrated his father Heaven (Uranus);
Kumarbi overthrew Anu (biting off his genitals);
Set killed his brother Osiris, the perfect pharoah; and then Horus, the son of Osiris, overthrows Set.
In some cases there are cyclical dieties, where the rebellious succession repeats in a cycle (such as the [trimurti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimurti) in Hinduism).

In all of these systems we have angelic spirits and demonic counterparts: from the Aztec Tzitzimitl to the Japanese [Oni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oni).


!!! quote "Deuteronomy 32:16-17"
    They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger. They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.






### Paradise Lost

Modern churches do not teach about angels and demons, and if they do it's likely to follow from Milton's Paradise Lost (most likely unconsciously).

In this view Satan rebelled against God and took one third of the angels with him. 
They organized in hell, built the city of *Pandemonium* and vowed to do evil against man.
Satan traveled to Eden and hid himself as a snake where he tempted Adam and Eve.
The fallen angels (one third of the heavenly hosts), demons, do everything in their power to deceive and hurt man, the created beings made in God's image.

Paradise Lost is obviously not canonical, but notice how so many assume this mythology is canonical; despite none of this story being reflected anywhere in the Bible nor anywhere in the early church.
Like the pagan mythologies, there seems to be something about these stories that must be true, as if they are hovering in or near an archytpal truth that we cannot quite articulate.





### Ancient Church

There were ranks of created spirits, heavenly hosts, and the fall of these spirits happened more than once. 

For example, a group of angels known as the watchers are the "sons of God" referenced in Genesis. 
These are the "sons of God" that had children with the "daughters of men". 
These hybrid children are known as *nephilim*, and are a precursor to the flood.
Demons are not only fallen angels, but also the spirits of the dead nephilim.

In the ancient world, Pagan gods were not imaginary or false, but very real created spirits, most of which fell from God's grace.
In the third rebellion against God, when the tower fell, man was placed under the territorial dominion of created spirits.


!!! quote "Deuteronomy 32:8"
    When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when He divided the sons of man, He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God.

    <center>![babel](/images/babel.jpg)</center>
    

The new-atheist critique that claims "you are an atheist with respect to Zeus or Thor," fails here because the ancient view (Christian or otherwise) believed in these very real powers and principalities. 
Ancient Christians understood that these created spirits had God-given dominion over the people of the earth. 
And the prophets cried for a savior.

!!! quote "Psalm 82"
    God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
    How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah
    
    Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
    Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
    They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
    
    I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
    But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
    
    Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.

As Christians we ought to believe these spirits exist -- including Zeus, Thor, and Quetzalcoatl -- but we should see them for what they really are.

!!! quote "Exodus 20:5"
    Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God

In this context, you'll find most all ancient pagan mythologies contain a deceitful inversion of Christianity, where mankind is reduced to the playthings of the gods, and the pantheon of pagan gods were the heros who overthrew the prior divine order, typically a tyrannical order.
Compare this to Christianity, where God is the Lord of Spirits, and man is created in the image and likeness of God, meant to judge the angels (the created spirits).








## Angels

Beyond just a *messenger* of God, what exactly are these beings that we call angels?

The exact nature of angels has never been fully revealed -- however we do know some things through scripture and early church tradition, as well as through various apocryphal sources.

We know that angels are conscious entities with free-will.
We are know they are created.
They are invisible, incorporeal, and like humans were also created in the image of God,

!!! quote "An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, by [St. John of Damascus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Damascus)"
    [God] is the maker and creator of angels, bringing them out of non-being into being, having created them after his own image as an incorporeal nature, like some spirit or immaterial fire, as the divine David says, "who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a fiery flame," describing their lightness, ardor, warmth, extreme sharpness, and acuity with regard to their longing for God and ministry to him and their sublimity and deliverance from all material thought.

The orthodox understanding of being "in the image of God" means more than just resemblance, but doing the works of God.
This is why these spirits act in accord with the will of God, doing His will.





### Bodies

We do not understand what angelic bodies are or how they work, but we know they have form and location (known to God).
We also know they are beings of intellect and exist in their assigned intellectual places (on earth or in heaven).

Importantly, angels are not corporeal beings existing within time and space as humans understand.
They can appear to those whom God wills, and in different forms, including in a human form.
They are purely spiritual, and in reference to humans do not have corporeal bodies.
But in reference to God they are embodied.
As created beings they exist solely within creation (for God created the heavens and the earth).

As both tradition and scripture can attest, angels are circumscribed --
 if an angel is in heaven it is not on earth, and if it is sent to earth it is not in heaven.
And despite their ability to extend anywhere in space (not confined by doors, locks and seals), they cannot be in two difference places simultaneously.







### Power

Tradition and scripture are both witness to the immense power of angels, able to influence all elements of creation.

As such, a fallen angel is a truly terrifying prospect.
Yet they are not God.
They are not omnipotent.
They are not omniscient.
They are not omnipresent.

And thankfully for us, fallen angels are subject to God's sovereignty. He allows this battle of will for our salvation.








### Free Will

Like man, angels are created beings with free will, free to choose good or evil.
However, unlike man, a fallen angel cannot repent.

!!! quote "Hebrews 2:16"
    For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.

Importantly, some angels fall.
Whereas with man, *all* of mankind is in a fallen state by nature -- our very existence is to live out the redemption that is Christ Jesus.

We can infer from this that angels have  natural differences from man, that is, by their nature they are unable to repent.
In other words, the nature of man allows us to repent, but the nature of angels is different enough from man that they -- by their nature -- are unable to repent.






### Time and Space

The best way to understand how and why fallen angels cannot repent, is to speculate on how angels experience time.
Angels do not experience time the way humans do (because otherwise it would be possible for them to repent) -- they are not within time the same way humans are, but exist within the ages, described as *motion without time* by Church fathers.

This concept of *motion without time* infers a different temporal dimension that is otherwise unavailable to mankind.

Angels are immortal with respect to humans, that is, they are not subject to death the way man is.

Angels do not reproduce and thus are genderless.

Angels are clearly not subject to time (and death) with the maleability that humans experience, allowing us to repent. Instead angels experience entire ages as we might experience a single moment, wherein they express their will onto an entire age. They cannot repent because their decisions have already been made from the beginning to the end of time as we understand it.

Similar to how we can understand that an angel is embodied in reference to God, but not embodied in reference to man -- angels exist within time in reference to God, but outside of time in reference to man.
This is because angels and man are both created, and only God is truly timeless and eternal.

Ultimately, We do not understand the exact nature of how angels experience time (whether it's a separate temporal dimension from ours), but we do know that they do not experience time as humans (or any animals) do. They do not mature and grow in character as humans do. And as such, fallen angels are unable to be redeemed.







### Derivative Light 

Exactly like man, the light from an angel (a created being) comes only from the creator. In other words the angels do not and cannot create ex-nihilo.
They do not shine with their own light, and thus should never be worshipped.

From a human perspective, angels are patterns of reality over time that we can participate within.
This includes the obvious case of participating in divine liturgy, but also the non-obvious cases of participating in technology or in politics or any worldly pattern.
It's important to understand that the worldly patterns that we participate within are in fact created spirits, and if they're directing you to Christ, then this is an angel, and if it's pointing in the opposite direction, then this is a fallen angel (such as the dark powers and principalities we struggle against daily).

As "messengers" angels deliver the revealed word of God, and the word of God is the [Logos](../logos/index.md), who is incarnate in the person of Christ Jesus.
The angels minister to the divine will, that we may participate within His divine will through Christ Jesus.

And further the "message" from angels is *Logia*, the revealed stories, which includes not only scripture, but every *logia*, such as mathematics, technology, and even geology.
In fact every scientific discipline is itself a communion of God and man (literally the person of Christ) and is ministered to by His angels, such that we can participate in these created spirits (these patterns of reality, be it technology, biology or even geology).

Likewise, those patterns of reality that point us away from Christ, away from Truth, these are fallen spirits, including political ideologies, nation states, central banks, and so on.
Even the scientific disciplines can be demonic.
You can know them by their fruits.
For example, if your study of biology leads you to conclude that gender is a man-made social construct, and that a man can transition into a woman, then you are not participating in an angelic spirit, you are participating in a demonic spirit.

The world is full of spirits.
We are living in the midst of spirits, angelic and demonic.
It is everywhere we look.

## Demons

The word "demon" shares the etymological root of the word *demonstrate*, much like the word "monster" means literally *to show*.

The God-allowed purpose for demons is to show our sin, our fall from grace. In practical terms it is to tempt, to torment in the darkness away from the light of God.
And God allows this in order to bring us towards salvation.

We are made in the image and likeness of God. It is no wonder the demons hate us so.

Ultimately, demons are fallen angels, and thus have very much the same nature as angels. They are incorporeal (compared to man), immortal, intellectual spirits with free-will outside of time (relative to our sense of time).
Any light they produce is derivative and they cannot create ex-nihilo.
Importantly, demons are completely subject and obedient to God.
Despite their hatred and rebellion, God allows their continued existence.

They were created good, as God does not create evil.
God allows evil only so that good may arise from evil, such as the redemption of man.

Evil is the absence of good...

Demons seek to bring creation back to chaos and emptiness, back to the nothingness from which we came ...

Demons can best be thought of as chaos monsters..
reducing creation back into a formless (chaos) void (emptiness).





### Death

Demons are integral to the cosmology of death, devouring that which has died and thus allowing rejuvenation of life, allowing an evolutionary process of life to persist in the face of death.






### Sin

The second great evil (after death) of mankind.
Sin entered the world and led to near complete corruption of mankind.. only Noah was redeemable.

Logismoi, thoughts, dark/evil thoughts

these are demons at the door, sometimes knocking, sometimes testing if the door is locked -- will you entertain those thoughts?

This part of our fallen nature. And only through Christ can we overcome.






### Dominion

The third great evil (after sin and death) came as a consequence of Babel..

!!! quote "Ephesians 6:12"
    For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

These are demons..






### Nephilim

The famed *giants* referenced throughout the Bible. *Nephelim* (נְפִילִים) is from Hebrew and is usually translated as *giants* or *fallen ones".

!!! quote "Genesis 6:4"
    There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.

!!! quote "Numbers 13:33"
    And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.

Unlike the classic Greek giants, the nephelim were not mindless brutes, but instead *mighty*, and *men of renown*. The size seems both metaphoric as well as literal.

... strongmen, metaphoric in some cases although the concept is universal across all anient religions.

!!! quote "2 Peter 2:4-5"
    For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; 
    And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly


!!! quote "Jude 1:5-6"
    I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. 
    And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.

### Satan

A seraphim, a throne guardian, an angel created completely good and given the task as guardian of the earth, protector of the terrestrial order..
By his will he turned against his own nature, turned against God ...



!!! quote "Job 1:6"
    Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.

adversary

!!! quote "Isaiah 14:12-15"
    How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
    For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
    I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.
    Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
    

!!! quote "Ezekiel 28:14-19"
    Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.
    Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.

    By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
    Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.

    Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.
    All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.

## Hands of God

!!! quote "1 Kings 22:19-23"
    And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner. And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so. Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.

The spirits (angels) on the right hand of the Lord are the elect, representing God's mercy.
The spirits (demons) on the left hand of God are the reprobate, serving their own evil ends, yet obeying the judgment of His decrees.

They were there in the beginning, and at each of the three cosmological rebellions, tempting man, introducing death, sin, and domination by dark powers.
