# Angels, Demons, and Antichrist

https://orthochristian.com/106805.html

Despite the nihilism of our modern age, many people still hold a vague belief in angels and demons. Even non-believers flirt with the idea. 
The prevalence of ghost stories within popular film and television is an indicator of how deeply this ancient idea persists.
It seems that far more people today are open to belief in angels and demons than they are to God. And as we'll see, this is no accident.


Technically, the word *angel* means a messenger of God. As such, it can best be thought of as a role. However when talking of angels we typically are not referring to a job title. We are referring to a spirit. We think of demons as evil spirits. If we believe in God then we typically view demons as fallen angels, fallen from God's grace.

The Bible, and the gospels in particular, are filled with references to angels and demons. Yet there's also references to other spiritual beings such as thrones, dominions, principalities. And there's references to archangels, hinting not only to job titles but instead to a rank, a hierarchy.
Additionally, there's references to heavenly hosts, to "sons of God", to cherubim and seraphim, and of course nephelim -- the famed giants precipitating the flood.

And most striking, there's even references to gods.
While modern Christians view the idea of other gods as fairy tales, they must ignore their own Bibles while doing so. Ancient Christians understood all these biblical references.


Interestingly, the Bible references these spiritual beings as if we already know what they are. There's no explanation of angels, no articulated taxonomy about this hierarchy of spirits.
How are we to make sense of this?



## Paradise Lost

Most churches do not teach about angels and demons, and if they do it's likely to follow from Milton's Paradise Lost (most likely unconsciously).

In this view Satan rebelled against God and takes one third of the angels with him. They organize in hell and vow to do evil against man.
Satan travels to Eden and hides himself as a snake where he tempts Adam and Eve.

In this view, the fallen angels, demons, do everything in their power to deceive and hurt man, the created beings made in His image.

Paradise Lost is obviously not canonical, but notice how so many assume the mythology is canonical; despite none of this story being reflected anywhere in the Bible nor anywhere in the ancient church.

## Ancient Church

In this view, there are explicit ranks of angels, of heavenly hosts, and the fall of angels happens more than once. A group of angels known as the watchers are the "sons of God" referenced in Genesis. And they have children with human women. These hybrid children are known as nephilim, and are a precursor to the flood -- demons are not only fallen angels, but also the spirits of the dead nephilim.

In this view, Pagan gods were not imaginary or false, but very real created spirits, most of which fell from God's grace.

The new atheist critique that claims "you are an atheist with respect to Zeus or Thor," fails here because the ancient view (Christian or otherwise) believed in these very real powers and principalities, Christians simply viewed them as created spirits with dominion over the earth. 

As Christians we ought to believe in all of these spirits, including Zeus and Thor and Ra, but we should see them for what they really are.

You'll find most all ancient pagan mythologies contain an inversion of Christianity, where mankind is but the plaything of the gods, and every pantheon of pagan gods were the heros who overthrew the prior order, typically a tyrannical order.
Compare this to Christianity, where God is the Lord of Spirits, and man is created in the image and likeness of God, meant to judge the angels (the created spirits).

## Demons

"Demon" shares the etymological root of the word *demonstrate*, much like the word "monster" is literally *to show*.

The purpose and the right place for demons is to show our sin, our fall from grace. In practical terms it is to tempt, to torment in the darkness away from the light of God.

We are made in the image and likeness of God. It is no wonder the demons hate us so.
