# Logos

Logos (Λόγος) means literally the *Word of God*.
Christ is the *Logos incarnate*, the Word made flesh. 
More specifically, Christ, the Logos, is Truth revealed in the flesh.


!!! quote "John 15:26-27"
    But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the *Spirit of truth*, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: 
    And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.


[Modern views](../modern-views/index.md) offer a subtle nihilism where truth is relativistic and reductionist, a reversion to the [ancient](../ancient-views/index.md) "gods" where there was no objective knowable truth.
Even modern
 [Orthodox](http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/doctrine1.aspx)
 Christians sometimes make this mistake, shying away from "truth" as if it was a western scholastic invention.

"Orthodox" means, literally, *right* (Ortho) *praise* or *worship* (Doxa), and there is nothing more *right worship* than the Logos, the Truth, made flesh.

!!! quote "John 1:1"
    In the beginning was the Word (Logos), and the Word (Logos) was with God, and the Word (Logos) was God.

!!! quote "John 15:16-17"
    Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. 
    These things I command you, that ye love one another.

Truth is transcendent, and knowable through Christ Jesus.
It was in the person of Christ that knowable objective truth was born, literally, born in Bethlehem.
The only scholastic invention was the demonic attempt to remove God from truth and epistemology, pretending truth was merely an attribute, a human articulation, rather than the person of Christ.

We cannot separate morality and meaning from truth, in other words, the words of God are true as well as good and meaningful.
The words of God are truth, morality, and meaning in life.
And Christ is truth, morality, and meaning -- made flesh.
He is the literal embodiment of the answer to the fundamental questions of life.


!!! quote "Alexander of Alexandria"
    For he set forth His proper personality, saying, 
    
    *"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by Him; and with out Him was not anything made that was made."*
    
    For who ever heard such things? or who, now hearing them, is not astonished, and does not stop his ears that these words should not touch them?

## -ology

Our nihilistic [modern view](../modern-views/index.md) tells us that words ending in *-ology* refer to "the study of".
The etymology is from *Logia* and refers to divine stories or words, specifically  *the word* (Logos) who is Christ Jesus.
It does not mean "the study of".
This can be demonstrated by the fact that most *-ology* suffixes make no reference to "the study of", e.g.,

!!! question "the study of?"
    * trilogy -- the study of 3?
    * epistemology -- the study of understanding?
    * apology -- the study of from/of?

The clearest refutation that -ology does not mean "the study of"  is the word "apology". Note the **ap-** in *apology* simply means "from" or "of", but what is an apology the study of, exactly? The study of *of*?

None of these make much sense.
However, if we recognize the etymological root *Logia* and *Logos* then these all make perfect sense, e.g.,

!!! info "Logos/Logia suffix"
    * trilogy -- 3 stories
    * epistemology -- understanding the word (revealed truth)
    * apology -- from the word of God. We still have this connotation with *Christian Apologetics*
    
    We can even get a better sense of the supposed "study of" scholastic disciplines,
    
    * biology -- life's story
    * eschatology -- the end story
    * etymology -- the original meaning of a word
    * geology -- the ground/soil's story
    * technology -- techne (art, skill, technique) stories

The ancient understanding of *Logia* dispels much of the confusion found in our modern view, and reveals the divine nature of knowledge and revelatory truth across all disciplines (and note that an academic discipline means literally to be a *disciple*).
It would seem that "the study of" inference is a vain and demonic attempt to remove God, replacing God with self-worship, as if man were God.

These are echoes of that same snake in the garden,

> Ye shall be as gods

Let us not use our God-given mind for self-worship or nihilism, but instead worship and glorify God, our creator -- the Spirit of Truth made known to us through Christ Jesus.

## Christology

Christology, the doctrines of Christ, or literally: the stories (Logia) of Christ (the Logos incarnate) -- the Logia of the Logos.
The revealed truth of Truth.

This is the only justifiable and sufficient epistemology, as the person of Christ is why we even have the word "epistemology".

!!! quote "John 14:6"
    Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

As affirmed in traditional Orthodox Christology, Christ Jesus is both God and man, fully human and fully God. 
He has two natures, two wills, human and divine working in perfect synergy.
The Word (Logos) of God condescended down into His creation, and further down into death (the actual death of God), so that He may save us by overcoming sin and death.

These are the doctrines of Christ -- of the Logos incarnate -- His life, death, resurrection and ascension.
This is the story of Truth, how we can know truth, and of our redemption and salvation from a fallen state.
