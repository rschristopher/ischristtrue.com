# Logos

Literally *the word*. In a Christian context the logos is the word of God; and Christ is the word made flesh.

## Logia

The plural of logos is *logoi*.
Logia is the plural form of *logion* which typically refers to divinely inspired words or stories. 
*Logia* was used to reference the divinely inspired word of God, i.e., scripture.


## -ology

While our [modern views](../modern-views/index.md) tell us that words ending in -ology refer to "the study of",
 the origin is of course from *Logia* and refers to stories or words, usually *the word*.
This can be demonstrated by the fact many -ology suffixes make no reference to "study", e.g.,

!!! question "the study of?"
    * trilogy -- the study of 3?
    * technology -- the study of techne (art, skill, technique)?
    * apology -- the study of from/of?

*Note* the **ap-** in *apology* simply means "from" or "of", but what is an apology the study of, exactly? The study of *of*?
None of these make much sense, however, if we recognize the etymological root of *logia* then these all make sense, e.g.,

!!! info "Logia suffix"
    * trilogy -- 3 stories
    * technology -- techne (art, skill, technique) stories
    * apology -- from/of the word (of God). We still have this connotation in *Christian Apologetics*, but more generally if you're making an apology you're probably explaining some prior words (misspoken or otherwise)
    
    We can even get a better sese  of the supposed "study of" scholastic disciplines,
    
    * cosmology -- the universe (order) story
    * geology -- the ground/soil story
    * eschatology -- the end story
    * etymology -- the original meaning of the word

The ancient understanding of *Logia* dispels much of the confusion found in the modern view.
It would seem that "study of" is a vain attempt to remove God and revelatory truth, replacing it with man, making a "study of" nature as if man were God.

Once again, echoes of that same snake in the garden,

> Ye shall be as gods

Let us not use our God-given mind to worship our self, but instead worship and glorify God, our creator -- the spirit of truth and source of all that is good.
