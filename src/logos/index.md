# Logos

Traditionally, Logos (Λόγος) is the *Word of God*.
Christ is the *Logos incarnate*, the Word made flesh. 
More specifically, Christ, the Logos, is the Spirit of Truth revealed.

[Modern views](../modern-views/index.md) offer a subtle nihilism where truth is relativistic and reductionist, a reversion to the [ancient](../ancient-views/index.md) "gods" where there was no objective knowable truth.
Even modern
 [Orthodox](http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/doctrine1.aspx)
 Christians sometimes make this mistake, shying away from "truth" as if it was a western scholastic invention.

"Orthodox" means, literally, *right* (Ortho) *praise* or *worship* (Doxa), and there is nothing more *right worship* than the Logos, the Truth, made flesh.

!!! quote "John 1:1"
    In the beginning was the Word (Logos), and the Word (Logos) was with God, and the Word (Logos) was God.

Truth is transcendent, and it is objectively knowable through Christ Jesus.
It was in the person of Christ that knowable objective truth was born, literally, born in Bethlehem.
The only scholastic invention was the demonic attempt to remove God from truth and epistemology, as if truth was merely an attribute, a human articulation, rather than the person of Christ.








## -ology

While our nihilistic [modern view](../modern-views/index.md) tells us that words ending in *-ology* refer to "the study of",
 the origin is of course from *Logia* and refers to stories or words, usually *the word* (Logos) who is Christ.
This can be demonstrated by the fact that most *-ology* suffixes make no reference to "the study of", e.g.,

!!! question "the study of?"
    * trilogy -- the study of 3?
    * epistemology -- the study of understanding?
    * apology -- the study of from/of?

*Note* the **ap-** in *apology* simply means "from" or "of", but what is an apology the study of, exactly? The study of *of*?

None of these make much sense, however, if we recognize the etymological root of *Logia* and *Logos* then these all make perfect sense, e.g.,

!!! info "Logos/Logia suffix"
    * trilogy -- 3 stories
    * epistemology -- understanding the word (revealed truth)
    * apology -- from the word of God. We still have this connotation with *Christian Apologetics*, but more generally if you're making an apology you're probably explaining something previously spoken or written.
    
    We can even get a better sense of the supposed "study of" scholastic disciplines,
    
    * cosmology -- revealed truth of the order of the universe
    * eschatology -- the end story
    * etymology -- the original meaning of the word
    * geology -- the ground/soil story
    * technology -- revealed truth of techne (art, skill, technique)

The ancient understanding of *Logia* dispels much of the confusion found in our modern view, and reveals the divine nature of knowledge and revelatory truth across all disciplines (and note that an academic discipline means literally to be a *disciple*).
It would seem that "the study of" ethos is a vain and demonic attempt to remove God, replacing God with self-worship, as if man were God.

These are echoes of that same snake in the garden,

> Ye shall be as gods

Let us not use our God-given mind for self-worship, but instead worship and glorify God, our creator -- the Spirit of Truth made known to us through Christ Jesus.











## Christology

Christology, the doctrines of Christ, or literally: the stories (Logia) of Christ (the Logos incarnate).
In other words, how we can know the truth (revealed truth) of Truth.
This is the only fully justified and sufficient epistemology, as the person of Christ is the origin of "epistemology".

!!! quote "John 14:6"
    Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

As affirmed in traditional Orthodox Christology, Christ Jesus is both God and man, fully human and fully God. He has two natures, two wills, human and divine working in perfect synergy.
The person who is the Word (Logos) of God condescended down into His creation, and then into death (the actual death of God), all that He may save us by overcoming sin and death.

These are the doctrines of Christ, of the Logos incarnate, His life, death, resurrection and ascension.
