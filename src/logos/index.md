# Logos

Literally *the word*. 
Classically speaking, the logos is the word of God.
Christ is the logos incarnate, the word made flesh. 
Oe more specifically, the Spirit of Truth made flesh.

[Modern views](../modern-views/index.md) offer a subtle nihilism where truth is relativistic and reductionist, a reversion to the [ancient](../ancient-views/index.md) "gods" where there was no objective knowable truth.
Even modern
 [Orthodox](http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/doctrine1.aspx)
 Christians make this mistake, shying away from "truth" as if it was a western scholastic invention.
Orthodox means literally *right* (Ortho) *praise* or *worship* (Doxa), and there is nothing more Orthodox than the Truth made flesh, that Truth is no longer transcendent but objectively knowable to us through Christ Jesus.

It was in the person of Christ Jesus that the knowable objective truth was born, literally born in Bethlehem.
To be clear, Christ is the Truth.
Truth is a person who is knowable to us.
And this person is God and man.











These are the doctrines of Christ, of the Logos incarnate, His life, death, resurrection and ascension.

## Logia

The plural of logos is *logoi*.
Logia is the plural form of *logion* which typically refers to divinely inspired words or stories. 
*Logia* was used to reference the divinely inspired word of God, i.e., scripture.


## -ology

While our [modern views](../modern-views/index.md) tell us that words ending in -ology refer to "the study of",
 the origin is of course from *Logia* and refers to stories or words, usually *the word*.
This can be demonstrated by the fact many -ology suffixes make no reference to "study", e.g.,

!!! question "the study of?"
    * trilogy -- the study of 3?
    * technology -- the study of techne (art, skill, technique)?
    * apology -- the study of from/of?

*Note* the **ap-** in *apology* simply means "from" or "of", but what is an apology the study of, exactly? The study of *of*?
None of these make much sense, however, if we recognize the etymological root of *logia* then these all make sense, e.g.,

!!! info "Logia suffix"
    * trilogy -- 3 stories
    * technology -- techne (art, skill, technique) stories
    * apology -- from/of the word (of God). We still have this connotation in *Christian Apologetics*, but more generally if you're making an apology you're probably explaining some prior words (misspoken or otherwise)
    
    We can even get a better sese  of the supposed "study of" scholastic disciplines,
    
    * cosmology -- the universe (order) story
    * geology -- the ground/soil story
    * eschatology -- the end story
    * etymology -- the original meaning of the word

The ancient understanding of *Logia* dispels much of the confusion found in the modern view.
It would seem that "study of" is a vain attempt to remove God and revelatory truth, replacing it with man, making a "study of" nature as if man were God.

Once again, echoes of that same snake in the garden,

> Ye shall be as gods

Let us not use our God-given mind to worship our self, but instead worship and glorify God, our creator -- the spirit of truth and source of all that is good.
