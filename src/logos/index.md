# Logos

Traditionally, Logos (Λόγος) is the *Word of God*.
Christ is the *Logos incarnate*, the Word made flesh. 
More specifically, Christ, the Logos, is the Spirit of Truth made flesh.

[Modern views](../modern-views/index.md) offer a subtle nihilism where truth is relativistic and reductionist, a reversion to the [ancient](../ancient-views/index.md) "gods" where there was no objective knowable truth.
Even modern
 [Orthodox](http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/doctrine1.aspx)
 Christians sometimes make this mistake, shying away from "truth" as if it was a western scholastic invention.
"Orthodox" means, literally, *right* (Ortho) *praise* or *worship* (Doxa), and there is nothing more *Orthodox* than the Logos, the Truth, made flesh.

!!! quote "John 1:1-5"
    In the beginning was the Word (Logos), and the Word (Logos) was with God, and the Word (Logos) was God.

Truth is transcendent, and it is objectively knowable to us through Christ Jesus.
It was in the person of Christ that knowable objective truth was born, literally, born in Bethlehem.
The only scholastic invention was the demonic attempt to remove God from epistemology, as if truth was merely an attribute, a human articulation, rather than the person of Christ.


## The Study of ...

The plural of logos is *logoi*.
*Logia* is the plural form of *logion* which refers to divinely inspired words or stories such as scripture.

While our nihilistic [modern view](../modern-views/index.md) tells us that words ending in *-ology* refer to "the study of",
 the origin is of course from *Logia* and refers to stories or words, usually *the word* (Logos) who is Christ.
This can be demonstrated by the fact most *-ology* suffixes make no reference to "the study of", e.g.,

!!! question "the study of?"
    * trilogy -- the study of 3?
    * technology -- the study of techne (art, skill, technique)?
    * epistemology -- the study of understanding?
    * apology -- the study of from/of?

*Note* the **ap-** in *apology* simply means "from" or "of", but what is an apology the study of, exactly? The study of *of*?
None of these make much sense, however, if we recognize the etymological root of *logia* and *Logos* then these all make sense, e.g.,

!!! info "Logos/Logia suffix"
    * trilogy -- 3 stories
    * technology -- techne (art, skill, technique) stories
    * epistemology -- understanding the word (revealed truth)
    * apology -- from the word of God. We still have this connotation in *Christian Apologetics*, but more generally if you're making an apology you're probably explaining something said or written.
    
    We can even get a better sense of the supposed "study of" scholastic disciplines,
    
    * cosmology -- the order of the universe story
    * geology -- the ground/soil story
    * eschatology -- the end story
    * etymology -- the original meaning of the word

The ancient understanding of *Logia* dispels much of the confusion found in the modern view.
It would seem that "the study of" is a vain attempt to remove God and revelatory truth, replacing it with man, making a "study of" nature as if man were God.

Once again, echoes of that same snake in the garden,

> Ye shall be as gods

Let us not use our God-given mind to worship self, but instead worship and glorify God, our creator -- the Spirit of Truth and source of all that is good.
