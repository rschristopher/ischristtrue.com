# Nativity

... a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.
And Joseph traveled with Mary who was 9-months pregnant from Nazareth in Galilee out to Bethlehem, the city of David.


## Birth of Jesus

!!! quote "Luke 2:6-7"
    And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. 
    And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.

*And so it was*, the creator of the universe, the very word of God, condescended down to us, to be born in poverty in the town of  Bethlehem.



### To the Temple


!!! quote "Luke 2:21"
    And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.

It was custom to offer a lamb as a burnt offering, however, as Joseph and Mary could not offer a lamb (due to their poverty) the two young pigeons was offered -- according to the law:

!!! quote "Leviticus 12:8"
    And if she is not able to bring a lamb, then she may bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons—one as a burnt offering and the other as a sin offering. So the priest shall make atonement for her, and she will be clean.

And at the temple, two prophets witnessed that this was the Mesaiah. The prophetess Anna, and also Simeon, a devout man from Jerusalem.
The Holy Spirit had revealed to Simeon that he would see the Mesaiah before his death.

!!! quote "Luke 2:28-32"
    Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,

    *Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:
    For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
    Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;
    A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.*




### To the Jews

Outside of Bethlehem there is ancient tower known as Migdal Eder -- *the tower of the flock* -- said to be the site from which the Messiah would be revealed.

!!! quote "Luke 2:8-14"
    And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 
    And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. 
    And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. 
    For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. 
    And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. 
    And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
    
    Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.

And so it was that the birth of the Messiah was announced to the Jews.





### To the Gentiles

!!! quote "Mattthew 2:1-2"
     Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, 
     Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

These wise men of the east, scholars most likely from the Medo-Persian empire -- *the magi* -- followed the star and came to find the prophecied Messiah.
They worshipped him and presented gifts: gold, frankincense and myrrh.
It is implied that these men not only knew of Jewish tradition, but also understood and sought to worship the monotheistic God of the Bible.

God inspired these gentiles, pagans, that through truth-seeking they would come and worship the infant Christ. His coming is for the salvation of all mankind, to restore man to God's intended purpose, that man may be *very good* in His eyes.

Interestingly, Herod did not learn of the Messiah from the shepherds of Midgal Eder. Herod did not learn this from the people under his rule, but from the magi, the outsiders, the gentiles.

!!! quote "Matthew 2:12"
    And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.








## Flight to Egypt

!!! quote "Matthew 2:13-15"
    And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.

    When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.


!!! quote "Hosea 11:1"
    When Israel was a child, I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son.









### New Covenant Prophecy

From great mourning into joy...

!!! quote "Matthew 2:16"
    Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, 
    and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.

... a reference back to Exodus, just as Pharoah attempts to slaughter all of the Hebrew infant males.

!!! quote "Exodus 1:22"
    And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

As stated in Matthew, Herod's massacre of the innocents fulfills the prophecy of Jeremiah,

!!! quote "Matthew 2:17-18"
    Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:

    “A voice was heard in Ramah,
    Lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,
    Rachel weeping for her children,
    Refusing to be comforted,
    Because they are no more.”

!!! quote "Jeremiah 31:15"
    Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.

The prophecy of *Jeremiah 31* is fulfilled, where we have the promise of a new covenant,

!!! quote "Jeremiah 31:31-34"
    Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a **new covenant** with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: 
    Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; 
    which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD: 
    But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, 
    I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
    And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: 
    for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: 
    for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.





## Return to Israel

!!! quote "Matthew 2:19-21"
    But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life. And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.


Jesus as the new Moses, the new David, and ultimately the new Adam.

!!! quote "Exodus 4:19"
    Now the LORD said to Moses in Midian, “Go, return to Egypt; for all the men who sought your life are dead.”

!!! quote "Psalms 80:8"
    You have brought a vine out of Egypt;
    You have cast out the gentile nations, and planted it.


!!! quote "Matthew 2:22-23"
    But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.

Nazareth in Galilee... the idea of the Messiah coming from such a town would have been looked upon with scandal and horror by the rabbis.

!!! quote "John 1:46"
    And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.


!!! quote "Isaiah 9:1-2"
    Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the Gentiles.
    The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.





### Childhood in Nazareth

!!! quote "Luke 2:40"
    And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.


Very little is written of His childhood...


!!! quote "Luke 2:41-51"
    His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover. And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast. When they had finished the days, as they returned, the Boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know it; but supposing Him to have been in the company, they went a day’s journey, and sought Him among their relatives and acquaintances. So when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him. Now so it was that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. 

    And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers. So when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, “Son, why have You done this to us? Look, Your father and I have sought You anxiously.”
    
    And He said to them, “Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father’s business?” But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them.
    Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them, but His mother kept all these things in her heart.



This child is the *word of God made flesh*.
He was born and grew up as any child.
Yet His words were wisdom itself, even life itself -- with complete knowledge of the Father.

!!! quote "Luke 2:52"
    And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.

As such, His very existence as the God-man marked the beginning of the kingdom of God,

!!! quote "Daniel 7:18"
    But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.



To be clear, He was born into the kingdom of Satan, of dominion by dark powers and principalities, of sin, and of death.
And in and by His life, Satan and his angels were cast out, sin was forgiven and death was overcome.



!!! quote "Isaiah 9:6-7"
    For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
    Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.


!!! quote "Matthew the Poor"
    A human person can barely contain his emotions when reading such moving words as these -- words which transcend time and eternity,
    which describe the light that would brust from the Galilean darkness and cover the world, which reveal a Child who would be God Himself!
    The young Christ would read passages such as these with a throbbing heart, for He could foresee the final culmination of their message: the Cross.
