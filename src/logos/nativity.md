# Nativity

... a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.
And Joseph traveled with Mary who was 9-months pregnant from Nazareth in Galilee out to Bethlehem, the city of David.

!!! quote "Luke 2:6-7"
    And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. 
    And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.

*And so it was*, the creator of the universe, the very word of God, condescended down to us, to be born in poverty in the town of  Bethlehem.

### To the Jews

Outside of Bethlehem there is ancient tower known as Migdal Eder -- *the tower of the flock* -- said to be the site from which the Messiah would be revealed.

!!! quote "Luke 2:8-14"
    And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 
    And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. 
    And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. 
    For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. 
    And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. 
    And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
    
    Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.

And so it was that the birth of the Messiah was announced to the Jews.



### To the Gentiles

!!! quote "Mattthew 2:1-2"
     Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, 
     Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

These wise men of the east, scholars most likely from the Medo-Persian empire -- *the Magi* -- followed the star and came to find the prophecied Messiah.
They worshipped him and presented gifts: gold, frankincense and myrrh.
It is implied that these men not only knew of Jewish tradition, but also understood and sought to worship the monotheistic God of the Bible.

It was here that Herod learns of the Messiah. Importantly, not from the shepherds of Midgal Eder, but from the magi, the outsiders, the gentiles.

!!! quote "Matthew 2:12"
    And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.



### New Covenant Prophecy

From great mourning into joy...

!!! quote "Matthew 2:16"
    Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, 
    and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.

... a reference back to Exodus, just as Pharoah attempts to slaughter all of the Hebrew infant males.

!!! quote "Exodus 1:22"
    And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

As stated in Matthew, Herod's massacre of the innocents fulfills the prophecy of Jeremiah,

!!! quote "Matthew 2:17-18"
    Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:

    “A voice was heard in Ramah,
    Lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,
    Rachel weeping for her children,
    Refusing to be comforted,
    Because they are no more.”

!!! quote "Jeremiah 31:15"
    Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.

The prophecy of *Jeremiah 31* is fulfilled, where we have the promise of a new covenant,

!!! quote "Jeremiah 31:31-34"
    Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a **new covenant** with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: 
    Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; 
    which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD: 
    But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, 
    I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
    And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: 
    for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: 
    for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
