# Angels, Demons, and Antichrist

https://orthochristian.com/106805.html

An *angel* is a literally a messenger of God.

Demons are angels who fell from God's grace. They exist at His pleasure.

This is the etymological root of the word *demonstrate*, much like the word "monster" is literally "to show".

The purpose and the right place for demons is to show our sin, our fall from grace. In practical terms it is to tempt, to torment in the darkness away from the light of God.

We are made in the image and likeness of God. It is no wonder the demons hate us so.
