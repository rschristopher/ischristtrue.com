# Angels, Demons, and Antichrist

https://orthochristian.com/106805.html

An *angel* is a literally a messenger of God.

Demons are angels who fell from God's grace. They exist at His pleasure.

This is the etymological root of the word *demonstrate*, much like the word "monster" is literally "to show".

The purpose and the right place for demons is to show our sin, our fall from grace. In practical terms it is to tempt, to torment in the darkness away from the light of God.

We are made in the image and likeness of God. It is no wonder the demons hate us so.

!!! quote "Isaiah 14:12-15"
    How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
    
    For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:
    
    I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.
    
    Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.
