# Angels, Demons, and Antichrist

https://orthochristian.com/106805.html

Angel is a literally a messenger of God.

Demons are those angels who fell from God's grace. They exist at His pleasure.

This is the etymological root of the word *demonstrate*, much like the word "monster" is literally "to show".

The purpose, the right place, for demons is to show our sin, our fall from grace. In practical terms it is to tempt, to torment in the darkness away from the light of God; as that is the logical consequence for beings created in the image and likeness of God to turn away from Him.
