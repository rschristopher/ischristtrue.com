## Nativity

!!! quote "John 1:1-5"
    In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

!!! quote "Galatians 4:4"
    But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son

In the many centuries before Christ, the Roman Empire rose to power.
In this era, we see the stability of trade routes -- culture and art spread from one end of the empire to the other.
We see the proliferation of the Greek Language, the flourishing of a Jewish diaspora, and a synthesis of Greek philosophy and Judaism (see the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint)).

In this synthesis the heathens began to recognize the necessity of a first principle of *logos* ... Anima mundi... stoicism

In a very profound sense the world (both Jew and Gentile) began to understand the nature of man's fallen state and their very real need for the Messiah.
There was a reason the Magi came with gifts..

!!! quote "John 1:14"
    And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.












## Temptations

three temptations, and we fall for them
 even today.


miracles, mystery, authority

We worship miracles, not God.
How easily tempted we are.

see Dostoevsky,
Brothers Karamazov 










## Coronation / Crucifixion

!!! quote "John 19:18-22"
    There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.
    
    Pilate also had a notice posted on the cross. It read:
    
    JESUS OF NAZARETH,
    THE KING OF THE JEWS.

    Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but only that He said, ‘I am the King of the Jews.’”
    
    Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”


INRI
Latin phrase IESVS·NAZARENVS·REX·IVDÆORVM (Jesus Nazarenus, rex Judæorum)


INBI
Greek version of the inscription, Ἰησοῦς ὁ Ναζωραῖος ὁ Bασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων. Some representations change the title to "ΙΝΒΚ" ὁ Bασιλεὺς τοῦ κόσμου ("The King of the World"), or "ΙΝΒΔ" ὁ Bασιλεὺς τῆς Δόξης ("The King of Glory"), not implying that this was really what was written, but reflecting the tradition that icons depict the spiritual reality rather than the physical reality. 

In Hebrew, the phrase is commonly rendered ישוע הנצרי ומלך היהודים (Yeshua` HaNotsri U'Melech HaYehudim IPA: [jeːʃuːɑʕ hɑnːɑtseri meleχ hɑjːəhuðiːm]), which translates instead to "Jesus the Nazarite and King of the Jews." This version was most probably chosen in order that the acronym constitute the tetragrammaton (יהוה) name corresponding with Yahweh or Jehovah. 

It is possible that the titulus was written in Aramaic, the local vernacular, rather than Hebrew.
