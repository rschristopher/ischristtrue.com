## Annunciation

!!! quote "John 1:1-5"
    In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

### Fullness of Time
!!! quote "Galatians 4:4"
    But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son

In the many centuries before Christ, the Roman Empire rose to power.
In this era, we see the stability of trade routes -- culture and art spread from one end of the empire to the other.
We see the proliferation of the Greek Language, the flourishing of a Jewish diaspora, and a synthesis of Greek philosophy and Judaism (see the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint)).

In this synthesis the heathens began to recognize the necessity of a first principle of *logos* ... Anima mundi... stoicism

In a very profound sense the world (both Jew and Gentile) began to understand the nature of man's fallen state and their very real need for the Messiah.

!!! quote "John 1:14"
    And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.


### The Angel Gabriel

!!! quote "Luke 1:30-38"
    And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. 
    And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. 
    He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: 
    And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. 

    Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? 

    And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: 
    therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. 
    And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. 
    For with God nothing shall be impossible. 

    And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.


*Be it unto me according to thy word*, this is *Mary's Fiat*, Mary's word.

And this young girl from the village of Nazareth became the first believer in Christ Jesus.

### Mary's Song

As *Matthew the Poor* wrote, 
 Mary's Song is a hymn belonging to both testaments.

!!! quote "Luke 1:46-56"
    My soul doth magnify the Lord,
    
    And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.
    
    For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: 
    
    For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
    
    For he that is mighty hath done to me great things;
    
    And holy is his name.
    
    And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.
    
    He hath shewed strength with his arm; 
    
    He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
    
    He hath put down the mighty from their seats, 

    And exalted them of low degree.
    
    He hath filled the hungry with good things; 

    And the rich he hath sent empty away.
    
    He hath holpen his servant Israel, 

    In remembrance of his mercy;
    
    As he spake to our fathers, 

    To Abraham, and to his seed for ever.


!!! quote "Zechariah 9:9"
    Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: 
    behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; 
    lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.

## Temptations

three temptations, and we fall for them
 even today.


miracles, mystery, authority

We worship miracles, not God.
How easily tempted we are.

see Dostoevsky,
Brothers Karamazov 










## Coronation / Crucifixion

!!! quote "John 19:18-22"
    There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.
    
    Pilate also had a notice posted on the cross. It read:
    
    JESUS OF NAZARETH,
    THE KING OF THE JEWS.

    Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but only that He said, ‘I am the King of the Jews.’”
    
    Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”


INRI
Latin phrase IESVS·NAZARENVS·REX·IVDÆORVM (Jesus Nazarenus, rex Judæorum)


INBI
Greek version of the inscription, Ἰησοῦς ὁ Ναζωραῖος ὁ Bασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων. Some representations change the title to "ΙΝΒΚ" ὁ Bασιλεὺς τοῦ κόσμου ("The King of the World"), or "ΙΝΒΔ" ὁ Bασιλεὺς τῆς Δόξης ("The King of Glory"), not implying that this was really what was written, but reflecting the tradition that icons depict the spiritual reality rather than the physical reality. 

In Hebrew, the phrase is commonly rendered ישוע הנצרי ומלך היהודים (Yeshua` HaNotsri U'Melech HaYehudim IPA: [jeːʃuːɑʕ hɑnːɑtseri meleχ hɑjːəhuðiːm]), which translates instead to "Jesus the Nazarite and King of the Jews." This version was most probably chosen in order that the acronym constitute the tetragrammaton (יהוה) name corresponding with Yahweh or Jehovah. 

It is possible that the titulus was written in Aramaic, the local vernacular, rather than Hebrew.
