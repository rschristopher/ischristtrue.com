## Annunciation

!!! quote "John 1:1-5"
    In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

### Fullness of Time
!!! quote "Galatians 4:4"
    But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son

In the many centuries before Christ, the Roman Empire rose to power.
In this era, we see the stability of trade routes -- culture and art spread from one end of the empire to the other.
We see the proliferation of the Greek Language, the flourishing of a Jewish diaspora, and a synthesis of Greek philosophy and Judaism (see the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint)).

In this synthesis the heathens began to recognize the necessity of a first principle of *logos* ... Anima mundi... stoicism
Meanwhile the remnants of the Babylonian and Medo-Persian empires had similarly been seeded with Jewish religious thought.
From east to west the gentile world was infused with Jewish monotheism; the innovative idea that there was one and only one God, and that we are made in His image;
 moreover that our suffering was not due to the whims of careless gods who are otherwise indifferent us, but that there was a fall from grace, an original sin,
 that through pride man turned away from his created purposee, turning away from the one true God.

the more nuanced understanding of this was not just fallen man living in a depraved state -- but that there were several rebellions, the last of which left man scattered across the earth, speaking in foreign languages, and ruled over by principalities aand powers; the false (or fallen) gods. 
While the Romans attempted to shove every local god into their pantheon from which they were the head,
 it was understood that the God of Israel was the one true God, and that there would be a coming Messiah who would rule in the midst of his enemies.
In other words, the Romans offered a worldly kingdom of man, and the Jewish prophecy spoke of redemption and a Kingdoom of God.

In a very profound sense, the world (both Jew and Gentile) began to understand the nature of man's fallen state and their very real need for the Messiah.

!!! quote "John 1:14"
    And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth.


### Angel Gabriel

!!! quote "Luke 1:30-38"
    And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. 
    And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. 
    He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: 
    And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. 

    Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? 

    And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: 
    therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. 
    And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. 
    For with God nothing shall be impossible. 

    And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.


*Be it unto me according to thy word*, this is *Mary's Fiat*, Mary's word.

And this young girl from the village of Nazareth became the first believer in Christ Jesus.

### Mary's Song

As *Matthew the Poor* wrote, 
 Mary's Song is a hymn belonging to both testaments.

!!! quote "Luke 1:46-55"
    My soul magnifies the Lord,<br />
    And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.<br />
    For He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant;<br />
    For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed.<br />
    For He who is mighty has done great things for me,<br />
    And holy is His name.<br />
    And His mercy is on those who fear Him<br />
    From generation to generation.<br />
    He has shown strength with His arm;<br />
    He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.<br />
    He has put down the mighty from their thrones,<br />
    And exalted the lowly.<br />
    He has filled the hungry with good things,<br />
    And the rich He has sent away empty.<br />
    He has helped His servant Israel,<br />
    In remembrance of His mercy,<br />
    As He spoke to our fathers,<br />
    To Abraham and to his seed forever.<br />


!!! quote "Zechariah 9:9"
    Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: 
    behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; 
    lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.


### Emmanuel


!!! quote "Matthew 1:19-23"
    Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. 
    But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, 
    fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: 
    for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. 
    And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: 
    for he shall save his people from their sins. 

    Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, 
    Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
















## Nativity

... a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.
And Joseph traveled with Mary who was 9-months pregnant from Nazareth in Galilee out to Bethlehem, the city of David.

!!! quote "Luke 2:6-7"
    And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. 
    And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.

*And so it was*, the creator of the universe, the very word of God, condescended down to us, to be born in poverty in the town of  Bethlehem.

### To the Jews

Outside of Bethlehem there is ancient tower known as Migdal Eder -- *the tower of the flock* -- said to be the site from which the Messiah would be revealed.

!!! quote "Luke 2:8-14"
    And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 
    And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. 
    And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. 
    For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. 
    And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. 
    And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,
    
    Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.

And so it was that the birth of the Messiah was announced to the Jews.



### To the Gentiles

!!! quote "Mattthew 2:1-2"
     Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, 
     Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

These wise men of the east, scholars most likely from the Medo-Persian empire -- *the Magi* -- followed the star and came to find the prophecied Messiah.
They worshipped him and presented gifts: gold, frankincense and myrrh.
It is implied that these men not only knew of Jewish tradition, but also understood and sought to worship the monotheistic God of the Bible.

It was here that Herod learns of the Messiah. Importantly, not from the shepherds of Midgal Eder, but from the magi, the outsiders, the gentiles.

!!! quote "Matthew 2:12"
    And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.



### New Covenant Prophecy

From great mourning into joy...

!!! quote "Matthew 2:16"
    Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, 
    and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.

... a reference back to Exodus, just as Pharoah attempts to slaughter all of the Hebrew infant males.

!!! quote "Exodus 1:22"
    And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

As stated in Matthew, Herod's massacre of the innocents fulfills the prophecy of Jeremiah,

!!! quote "Matthew 2:17-18"
    Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:

    “A voice was heard in Ramah,
    Lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,
    Rachel weeping for her children,
    Refusing to be comforted,
    Because they are no more.”

!!! quote "Jeremiah 31:15"
    Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.

The prophecy of *Jeremiah 31* is fulfilled, where we have the promise of a new covenant,

!!! quote "Jeremiah 31:31-34"
    Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a **new covenant** with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: 
    Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; 
    which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD: 
    But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, 
    I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
    And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: 
    for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: 
    for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.



## Temptations

three temptations, and we fall for them
 even today.


miracles, mystery, authority

We worship miracles, not God.
How easily tempted we are.

see Dostoevsky,
Brothers Karamazov 










## Coronation / Crucifixion

!!! quote "John 19:18-22"
    There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.
    
    Pilate also had a notice posted on the cross. It read:
    
    JESUS OF NAZARETH,
    THE KING OF THE JEWS.

    Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but only that He said, ‘I am the King of the Jews.’”
    
    Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”


INRI
Latin phrase IESVS·NAZARENVS·REX·IVDÆORVM (Jesus Nazarenus, rex Judæorum)


INBI
Greek version of the inscription, Ἰησοῦς ὁ Ναζωραῖος ὁ Bασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων. Some representations change the title to "ΙΝΒΚ" ὁ Bασιλεὺς τοῦ κόσμου ("The King of the World"), or "ΙΝΒΔ" ὁ Bασιλεὺς τῆς Δόξης ("The King of Glory"), not implying that this was really what was written, but reflecting the tradition that icons depict the spiritual reality rather than the physical reality. 

In Hebrew, the phrase is commonly rendered ישוע הנצרי ומלך היהודים (Yeshua` HaNotsri U'Melech HaYehudim IPA: [jeːʃuːɑʕ hɑnːɑtseri meleχ hɑjːəhuðiːm]), which translates instead to "Jesus the Nazarite and King of the Jews." This version was most probably chosen in order that the acronym constitute the tetragrammaton (יהוה) name corresponding with Yahweh or Jehovah. 

It is possible that the titulus was written in Aramaic, the local vernacular, rather than Hebrew.
