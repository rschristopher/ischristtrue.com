Sacraments, evangelical mysteries


And the Mysteries consist of
 something natural,
 and of something supernatural;
 and are not bare signs of the promises of God.
For then they would not differ
 from circumcision —
 what could be worse than that [idea]? 
We acknowledge them to be, 
 of necessity, 
 efficient means of grace to the receivers.


## 1. Holy Baptism

"Go and make disciples of all the nations, 
 baptizing them in the name of the Father, 
 and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;"
 {Matthew 28:19}

"He that believes and is baptized 
 shall be saved, 
 but he that does not believe 
 shall be condemned."
 {Mark 16:16}






## 2. Confirmation

that is to say, of the Holy Myron 
 or Holy Chrism,

"But ye — tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem,
 until ye be endued with power from on high."
 {Luke 24:49} 

With which they were endued by 
 the coming of the Holy Spirit, 
 and this the 
 Mystery of Confirmation signifies; 
 concerning which Paul also wrote
 in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, 
 chap. 1, and Dionysius the Areopagite
 more explicitly.




## 3. Priesthood

"This do ye for My Memorial;"
 {Luke 22:19}

"Whatever you bind and loose 
 upon the earth shall be bound 
 and loosed in the heavens."
 {Matthew 18:18}







## 4. Divine Liturgy

"Take, eat; This is My Body;"
 {Matthew 26:26;
  Mark 14:22;
 and cf. Luke 22:19;
 1 Corinthians 2:24}

"Drink all of It;
 This is My Blood of the New Testament;"
 {Matthew 26:27; 
 and cf. Mark 14:24; 
 Luke 22:20; 
 1 Corinthians 2:25} 

"Unless you eat the Flesh of the Son of Man,
 you do not have life in yourselves."
 {John 6:53}




## 5. Marriage

 when, having recited the things 
 which had been spoken thereof in the
 Old [Testament], 
 He, as it were, set His seal thereto 
 by the words,

"Those whom God hath joined together, 
 do not let man put asunder,"
 {Matthew 19:6} 

and this the divine Apostle also
 calls a great Mystery.
{Ephesians 5:32}







## 6. Penance

with which is joined sacramental confession,
 by the words, 

"If you forgive the sins of any,
 they are forgiven them;
 if you retain the sins of any,
 they are retained." [NRSV];
 {John 20:23}

"unless you repent,
 you will [all] likewise perish."
 {Luke 13:3,5}





7. Holy Oil

 or Prayer-Oil is spoken of in Mark,
 {Mark 6:13}

 and is expressly witnessed to by the
 Lord’s brother. {James 5:14}
