# Sin

To miss the mark.
To turn away from God.

There is no philosophical problem 
 of evil -- it could only be a problem
 to one who worships rationality
There is no evil if one has perfect
 knowledge. 
All evil is born of ignorance and lies
And the original sin was to turn away 
 from God (something we see to this day)

Thosw who sin, are slaves to sin,
 which means they lack free will,
 that is, no ability to actualize
 ones will.
A slave to sin is perfectly predictable,
 a plaything of demons.
And it always ends up in the same evil.

Free will begins with one choosing God,
 to go to Jesus.
