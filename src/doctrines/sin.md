# Sin

!!! quote "Genesis 4:7"
    sin is crouching at your door; it desires you, but you must master it.


Sin means literally to miss the mark;
to turn away from God.

Although they are obviously related, sin is not the same as evil. Evil is the consequence of sin (being apart from God). And sin by itself is not evil.

In fact, as God explained to Cain, we must master the sin crouching at our door, the temptations that would pull us away from God and into death.
These are the temptations Christ overcame.

All things in their place, even the sin crouching at your door.

!!! quote "Luke 4:7-8"
    If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.
    And Jesus answered and said unto him, **Get thee behind me**, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.




There is no evil if one has perfect
 knowledge. 
 
All evil is born of ignorance and lies.
And the original sin was to turn away 
 from God (something we see to this day)

Thosw who sin, are slaves to sin,
 which means they lack free will,
 that is, no ability to actualize
 one's will.
A slave to sin is perfectly predictable,
 a plaything of demons.
And it always ends up in the same evil.

Free will begins with one choosing God,
 to turn to Christ.
