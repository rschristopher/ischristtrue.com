# Nature of Hell

On the nature of hell.
On what happens to our immortal soul
 after death.

There is a longing by nihilists
 -- *from
 the humanists who don't consider
 themselves nihilists, to the
 realists who scoff at the very idea* --
 that after death is nothingness.
They don't just believe this, 
 they yearn for this.
And note when they say,
 "I'll return back to where I was
 before I was born".
They believe they came from a
 great nothingness,
 that their entire being
 was created *from nothingness*
 -- and they wonder why the
 astute theists will point out
 that they secretly believe in God
 (for who else creates *ex nihilo*?)

But is this really the end fate
 of a human soul? 
To return to nothingness?
Of course they yearn for this,
 because any serious thinker
 will feel in their soul
 a terrible fear, a fear of immortality,
 a fear of God.

The naive half-educated *"intellectuals"*
 of our time imagine immortality
 to be a good and desirable thing, 
 but that it is just the
 fantasy of "less evolved"
 superstitious Christians.
That they are more evolved and accept
 the truth of their nothingness.
But this, as we will see, is itself
 a feel-good fantasy.
Note these same "*intellectuals*"
 will take seriously 
 trans-hunanist
 arguments
 and want to "upload" their consciousness
 into a machine.

Truth is, Christians fear immortality,
 because they fear God -- they fear
 the judgment that is due.
Because they know, deep down, that they
 are unworthy of His grace.
And that only through the intercession
 of Christ will they receive salvation.

As much as some pious half-hearted
 Christians imagine themselves as already
 saved, deep down they know,
 that it was us
 who crucified the Son of God.
The creator of the universe became man,
 and we killed him.
And let's be clear, the creator of
 the universe didn't just appear as 
 a symbol, but became man --
 the totality of God fit within
 a single human being.
For we were created in the image
 and likeness of God.

A single human life is worth more to God
 than the entire cosmos.
The essence of God cannot be contained
 in all of the stars in existence,
 let alone the person of the son.
And yet, there He was.
The creator of all, born in a manger.

The human being is immortal, and still
 retains even after the fall,
 an immortal soul.
We once beheld the face of God,
 and we shone with His radiance,
 with no shame or vulnerability in
 our being.
It is after the fall, turning away
 from God, did we see our material
 bodily nature, our vulnerability,
 our nakedness.
And in our sin of pride, of wanting
 to be as God,
 was death set upon creation.

And so, what happens to such exalted
 creatures, made in the image and likeness
 of God, when we die?
Nothingness?
This is the desire of the atheist --
 because the alternative is to frightful
 to bear.
For if God is real, then man's soul 
 is immortal,
 and by not accepting salvation,
 salvation that
 which is freely given, how will
 such a soul respond to eternity
 without God to sustain them?
They will seek the cold nothingness,
 for the alternative is the light of
 God, who they were made to glorify.
Such light would be unbearable.
They exist in meaningless darkness,
 seeking for nothingness, turning
 away from God whose light
 burns their sin, their pride, yet they
 hold and cling to pride,
 to their resentment of God,
 the God who won't let them return
 to nothingness, for that is
 to erase their created soul as a mistake,
 which in their pride is what they would do.
God's love is here, ready to
 save, and yet they still refuse, forever,
 burning in pain while desperate for
 the abyss of nothingness.
This is hell.

If you want to understand hell,
 understand the value of your life,
 the value of a single human life.
Recognize the divinity of the lowliest
 of human lives.
Remember that our souls are immortal,
 and that we
 (created in the image and likeness of the creator of the universe)
 will not return to nothingness.
A human soul is not destined for nirvana nor moksha --
 every soul is destined for truth, be it glorious, be it cold, be it fire.
God have mercy on us.
