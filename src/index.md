## What is this?

We are seeking 
 [truth](truth.md), wherever that may take us.

Our
 [modern views](modern-views/index.md)
 have given us absurdity, moral relativism, a meaning crisis and cultural rot. We are watching our civilization decay before our eyes. Perhaps it is already dead, which would explain the parasitic global bureaucracies feasting on the carcass of what was once known as western civilization.

We look to [ancient views](ancient-views/index.md) and find that all past civilizations not rooted in truth ended exactly this same way.
This is familiar territory.

An honest seeker will find that the [nature of truth](truth.md) is rooted in Christianity, and specifically in the person that is Christ Jesus. 
So we ask a simple question,

> Is Christ true?

Upon deeper analysis, this question is circular and presupposes that truth exists and is objectively knowable, which as we will see, is identical to the presupposition that Christ exists and is objectively knowable. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

We are asking this question from where we stand, atop the remnants of a dead civilization in the midst of a meaning crisis. 
Our [enlightenment](modern-views/enlightenment.md) view presupposes knowable truth, but without God and without a mediator -- so we start where we start, clawing our way out of the existential despair of our time and into the Spirit of Truth. Whether we like it or not, our entire worldview comes from ancient Christian views, so we aim to delve into that past and see if we can find what is real, what is true.

## Who is R.S. Christopher?

Reprobus Saint Christopher is the dog-headed saint of travelers and [Bitcoiners](https://isbitcointrue.com). 
While [revisionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Christopher) like to say that St. Christopher was an ordinary man, arrogantly proclaiming that "dog-headed men" never actually existed and that it was all just a translation error or worse, a myth -- no, Reprobus actually was a dog-headed giant; a monster from beyond the fringes, haunting the marginalia of our ancient world. And, in the pursuit of power, Reprobus instead found salvation in Christ.

And even now St. Christopher helps travelers and Bitcoiners find their way.

## Who are you really?

No one important, just a pseudonym. 
It doesn't really matter who I am -- what matters is whether the claims about Christ are true, or not.

Perhaps more importantly, who are you? 
Are you a seeker of truth? 
Are you willing to challenge conventional wisdom and deeply held beliefs? 
Is truth that important to you?

The arguments put forth in these essays may challenge the status quo to which you cling. 
It might be uncomfortable. 
So again I ask, is truth really important to you?
