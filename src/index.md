## What is this?

We are seeking 
 [truth](truth.md), wherever that may take us.
Our
 [modern views](modern-views/index.md) l
 have given us absurdity, moral relativism, a meaning crisis and culture rot. We are watching our civilization decay before our eyes. Perhaps it is already dead, which would explain the parasitic global bureaucracies feasting on the carcass of what was once known as western civilization.

We look to [ancient views](ancient-views/index.md) and find that all past civilizations not rooted in truth ended exactly this same way.
This is familiar territory.

An honest seeker will find that the [nature of truth](truth.md) is rooted in Christianity, and specifically in the person that is Jesus Christ. So we ask a simple question,

> Is Christ true?

Upon deeper analysis, this question is circular and presupposes that truth exists and is objectively knowable, which as we will see, is identical to the presupposition that Christ exists and is objectively knowable. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

We are asking this question from where we stand, atop the remnants of a dead civilization in the midst of a meaning crisis. Our enlightenment view presupposes objectively knowable truth, but without God and without a mediator -- so we start where we start, clawing our way out of the existential despair of our time and into truth. Whether we like it or not, our entire worldview comes from ancient Christian views, so we aim to delve into that past and see if we can find what is real, what is true.

## Who are you really?
