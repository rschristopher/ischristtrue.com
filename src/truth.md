# Who or What is Truth?

This is perhaps the most basic of any
 fundamental question one can ask.
We might start with the most fundamental,

What is real? 

How do we make sense of what is real?

In other words, whatever *we* are,
 are perceiving of an external world
 that we are agents within,
 acting out in the world,
 and when we seek truth,
 we are seeking to know the world
 (and ourselves)
 as it actually exists.
Is the world we perceive real?
Is it all a dream?
Is it a delusion from a demon?
Is it radically different than
 the way we perceive it?
