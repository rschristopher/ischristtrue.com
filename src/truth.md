# Who or What is Truth?

This is perhaps the most basic of any
 fundamental question one can ask.
We might start with the most fundamental,

What is real? 

How do we make sense of what is real?

In other words, whatever *we* are,
 we are perceiving an external world,
 and we are agents within that world --
 and when we seek truth,
 we are seeking to know the world
 (and ourselves)
 as it actually exists.
Is the world we perceive real?
Is it all a dream?
Is it a delusion from a demon?
Is it all a simulation?
Is it radically different than
 the way we perceive it?



## Knowing what actually exists 

Can we know anything?

What does it mean to know?

Epistemology




## Knowing Truth

Is there objective knowable truth?

In the [modern view](modern-views/)
 there is no objective knowable truth.
There is word games.
There is a will to power.
There is power and oppression.
There is the deconstruction of a
 everything into games of power
 and oppression.

To be clear, if you claim to be a
 rationalist,
 an
 empiricist,
 someone who follows
 science
 and does not believe in
 spirits or anything you can't
 see with your own eyes,
 then you will find yourself
 unmoored from any first principles
 necessary for even a pretense
 of objective truth.
Non-belief in an otherwise "unseen" reality 
 doesn't negate the existence of that reality.
You don't live in a mechanistic universe.
You don't live in absurdist universe.
And you certainly don't live in a 
 postmodern
 universe.

The postmodern "deconstructions" of
 [modern views](modern-views/)
 may yield absurdity,
 but they are apt critiques
 of the rationalism we see in
 secular culture.
There is indeed a patriarchal hierarchy
 which is the foundation for any and all
 truth claims.
The patriarchy is real!
And yet it's not man-made.
On some level the postmodernists
 know this, and still reject it
 (and hence reject *truth* itself).

My truth, your truth ...

For truth to have any meaning,
 then truth must transcend all subjective
 perspectives.
Something is true if it is objectively true,
 and knowledge of this objectivity
 is what brings people to the "Truth".



## Attributes of Truth

Truth exists, and is knowable.
Truth is experienced in very personal ways,
 primarily in sense perceptions.

Modern views understand truth as an attribute
 unto itself, that something is true or it is not.

Ancient Views understood truth as a spirit,
 which means it has personhood,
 as all spirits do.
If there is a *spirit of truth*,
 then rather than ask,
 "what is true?"
 we ought to ask
 "who is truth?"





## Who is Truth?

Truth, or the spirit of truth,
 like any spirit,
 can be thought of as a
 pattern of reality.
A pattern of reality that is
 objectively real (and not
 a veil of delusions
 and perceptions).
In other words, that which
 is objectively real is
 the spirit we are referring.
And rather than a *what*,
 this is better understood as a *who*.

A spirit is any pattern of reality with 
 a non-material consciousness,
 which is all consciousness.
It has agency and 
 self awareness.
It has personal attributes.

If you haven't thought of a spirit
 in this way, and instead
 think of spirits as
 translucent ghosts that don't 
 interact with our world but hover
 about --
 this is most certainly not a spirit,
 this is a naive caricature.
Anyone can "see" a spirit, if not directly
 then through the patterns of reality
 over time.
A spirit is just that, a pattern of
 reality that has conscious agency.

Think of the spirit of a city.
A city over time will grow and
 move about like an amoeba
 (though we rarely think of it this way).
In a secular worldview we might refer
 to the "emergent" patterns and behavior
 of such a complex system.
But the word "emergence" is what if
 not consciousness?
Such an entity reacts to the outside
 world beyond its "body",
 with sense organs and means
 with which to actualize its will.
It might make demands of us, we might
 be mere components in this 
 "emergent" consciousness --
 the same way the bacteria in your
 gut are an integral part of the
 emergent consciousness that is known
 as "you".

In this way we can see *spirits*
 everywhere, im all manner of complex system
 that we interact with and participate in.
These are patterns of reality over time,
 they
 are not normally visible because through
 our biased thinking we rarely see
 the consciousness of anything other
 than ourselves and other human beings
 (if even that).
But everywhere in nature, in our own
 interactions and what we observe around us,
 this "emergence" of consciousness is everywhere.

Spirits everywhere, even in the most simple
 systems, such as a leaf turning to face
 the sun.
In our secular mechanistic presuppositions
 we imagine this as purely "natural" causes,
 as if that explained anything.
We often play word games with what are
 objectively spirits making themselves
 known to us.
They have implicit meaning, beauty, and functions
 that are far transcendent of the limits
 of a mechanistic worldview.
Those trapped in such a 
 mechanistic worldview are blind to
 the everpresent spirits in front of their
 own face, pretending with
 absurd pride that they are the originators
 of all the beauty and meaning
 they perceive, that only the *functions*
 of what they're perceiving is real.

But even so, even if only the causal functions
 of these complex emergent patterns are
 real, then is that not evidence of spirits
 everywhere?
If you look upon a thunderstorm do you see
 the entirety of the storm all at once?
No, it is a pattern over time, a spirit.
And it is much like your own consciousness,
 a pattern of reality over time.
Your consciousness emerges from the
 complex interactions from your 
 body and mind;
 much like the thunderstorm emerges
 from the complex interactions
 of water vapor, pressure, and electricity.

Who then is the Spirit of Truth?

All things as they are,
 all patterns, simple and complex,
 all that was, is, and will be --
 including our own bodies and minds --
 this is the spirit of truth.
What kind of being, what kind of spirit
 could encompass all?

Well, turns out there's only a handful of
 possible answers.
Either such a being exists, or doesn't.
And if such a being does exist,
 they are either knowable, or not.

This somewhat crude classification
 can handily separate the multitude
 of religious worldviews and metaphysical
 paradigms into a useful filter, as ultimately
 we are only concerned with the existence
 of such a divine spirit of truth
 that is itself knowable.

If the spirit of truth does not exist,
 or is not knowable to us,
 then gone too is any hope of any defensible
 epistemology.
In other words, we can't know anything and
 there cannot be knowable truth about ourselves
 or the universe without a spirit of truth
 making knowledge available to us.

Whoever this spirit of truth is,
 this universal pattern of reality,
 it is a being who grants us knowledge
 of ourselves and the world we live in.
