# Who or What is Truth?

This is perhaps the most basic of any
 fundamental question one can ask.
We might start with the most fundamental,

What is real? 

How do we make sense of what is real?

In other words, whatever *we* are,
 we are perceiving an external world,
 and we are agents within that world --
 and when we seek truth,
 we are seeking to know the world
 (and ourselves)
 as it actually exists.
Is the world we perceive real?
Is it all a dream?
Is it a delusion from a demon?
Is it radically different than
 the way we perceive it?



## Knowing what actually exists 

Can we know anything?

What does it mean to know?

Epistemology




## Knowing Truth

Is there an objective knowable truth?

In the [modern view](modern-views/)
 there is no objective knowable truth.
There is word games.
There is a will to power.
There is power and oppression.
There is the deconstruction of a
 everything into games of power
 and oppression.

To be clear, if you claim to be a
 rationalist,
 an
 empiricist,
 or even someone who follows
 science
 and is otherwise a
 non-believer,
 then you will find yourself
 unmoored from any first principles
 necessary for even a pretense
 of objective truth.
Non-belief in otherwise "unseen" reality 
 doesn't negate the existence of that reality.
You don't live in a mechanistic universe.
You don't live in absurdist universe.
And you certainly don't live in a 
 postmodern
 universe.

The postmodern "deconstructions" of
 [modern views](modern-views/)
 may yield absurdity,
 but they are apt critiques.
There is indeed a patriarchal hierarchy
 which is the foundation for any and all
 truth claims.
The patriarchy is real!
And it's not man-made.
On some level the postmodernists
 know this, and still reject it
 (and hence reject *truth* itself).

My truth, your truth 

For truth to have any meaning,
 then truth must transcend all subjective
 perspectives.
Something is true if it is objectively true,
 and knowledge of this objectivity
 is what brings people to the "Truth".



## Attributes of Truth

Truth exists, and is knowable from the
 source of truth.
Truth is experienced in very personal ways,
 primarily in sense perceptions.

Modern views understand truth as an attribute
 unto itself, that something is true or it is not.

Ancient Views understood truth as a spirit,
 which means it has personhood,
 as all spirits do.
If there is a *spirit of truth*,
 then the better question is
 "who is truth?"
 rather than
 "what is true 

Agency

Self awareness

Consciousness
