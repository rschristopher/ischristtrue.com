Christology 



## Temptations

three temptations, and we fall for them
 even today.
 


miracles, mystery, authority

We worship miracles, not God.
How easily tempted we are.

see Dostoevsky,
Brothers Karamazov 



"There is no possible event in life for which His grace is not sufficient."
Dr. Larry Crabb

"No situation is so desperate that God's grace is not sufficient."




## Meaning and Motivation

meaning in life is inescapable, and can be observed in three ways,

1. way of the slave - fear
2. way of the mercenary - reward
3. way of Christ - love

In other words, we can operate out of fear, fear of suffering, fear of death, fear of God if one is wise. This is our base motivation when all else fails. This is the one source of meaning we cannot escape.

And we can similarly operate out of reward, the mercenary mindset. We will seek reward and look for the shortest path to reward within the bounds of our fear of suffering.

Christ offers a third way, that of love, giving glory to God.









!!! quote "St. Joseph the Hesychast"
    Whatever we do not give to God to use in our ascetic struggles will be used by the other one (i.e., Satan). Our Lord gives us the commandment to love Him with all our souls and all our heart [Matthew 22:37], so that the evil one cannot find a place to rest within us.
