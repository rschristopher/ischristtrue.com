# Who is Christ?

If we first understand the nature of
 [truth](truth.md)
 then we should be asking who is this  *Spirit of Truth*, the creator of all, and how is such a transcendent source knowable to us?
The person of Christ is both *man* and *God*.
Without Christ then God would remain forever out of our reach, too distant and too transcendent for our meager minds to dare approach.

The very creator of the universe, of time and space, of reason itself, the source of all, can only be made knowable to us if the creator would condescend down to us in our sorrowful state.
In order to lift us up, He must come down to us.
The story of Christ and His life is exactly that story. From the fall of man to our redemption through the life and death of Christ.

And in this story of Christ do we also learn the nature of man and our created purpose. For God condescended down to us, the creator of all, born in a manger. A child like any other -- for we are created in the image and likeness of God. He could not be contained in all the galaxies in the universe, but instead as a human child born in Bethlehem.

## Temptations

three temptations, and we fall for them
 even today.


miracles, mystery, authority

We worship miracles, not God.
How easily tempted we are.

see Dostoevsky,
Brothers Karamazov 



"There is no possible event in life for which His grace is not sufficient."
Dr. Larry Crabb

"No situation is so desperate that God's grace is not sufficient."




## Meaning and Motivation

meaning in life is inescapable, and can be observed in three ways,

1. way of the slave - fear
2. way of the mercenary - reward
3. way of Christ - love

In other words, we can operate out of fear, fear of suffering, fear of death, fear of God if one is wise. This is our base motivation when all else fails. This is the one source of meaning we cannot escape.

And we can similarly operate out of reward, the mercenary mindset. We will seek reward and look for the shortest path to reward within the bounds of our fear of suffering.

Christ offers a third way, that of love, giving glory to God.









!!! quote "St. Joseph the Hesychast"
    Whatever we do not give to God to use in our ascetic struggles will be used by the other one (i.e., Satan). Our Lord gives us the commandment to love Him with all our souls and all our heart [Matthew 22:37], so that the evil one cannot find a place to rest within us.



!!! quote "Matthew 22:34-40"
    But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

If we are to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind then we are to give him everything that we are -- all our sins, all our talents, all our suffering, all our joys, everything. 
And even how we relate to others, we are to love our neighbors as ourselves.

This may seem impossible, and that's the point, we are called to something greater than ourselves. We are called to Christ, and by giving everything to Christ we become aware of the God-given grace that sustains us. We become aware of our part in His will, for His will be done.
We become the actuality of His triumph over sin and death.









## Theosis

To become like Christ

[metanoia](ancient-views/metanoia.md)

We sometimes refer to this relationship to God as familial, as a toddler to parent. A parent let's their toddler stumble about on its own will, while simultaneously being guided about by the parent's will, as they're the one's holding up their child as it tries to take its first few steps.

While similar, this is radically inverted from our relationship with God. A parent guides their child so that the child will become self reliant, and no longer need their parent in order to walk.

Yet our relationship with God means to ask and receive His help, and to let His will and our will become one. We are not aiming at growing stronger ourselves independent of God (as would our children), we are growing stronger due to a closer relationship with God, such that all things, our sins, our joys, everything -- are offered up to God and we receive His grace. Theosis, becoming like Christ, means necessarily to become more and more willfully dependent on God.
