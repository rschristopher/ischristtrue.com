# Who is Christ?

If we first understand the nature of
 [truth](truth.md)
 then we should be asking who is this  *Spirit of Truth*, the creator of all, and how is such a transcendent source knowable to us?
The Spirit of Truth *is* Christ Jesus, and He is necessarily both *man* and *God*.
Without Christ then God would remain forever out of our reach, too distant and too transcendent for our meager minds to dare approach.
For who are we to know God?


## Revelation 

The very creator of the universe, of time and space, of reason itself, the source of all, can only be made knowable to us if God would condescend down to us in our sorrowful state.
In order to lift us up, He must come down to us.
The story of Christ and His life is exactly that story. It is our story. From the fall of man to our redemption through the life and death of Christ.

And in this story do we also learn the nature of ourselves and our purpose in life. For the God of all condescended down to us -- the Almighty, born in a manger. A child like any other -- for we are created in the image and likeness of God. God could not be contained in all the stars and all the galaxies in the universe, but was born as a mere human child in Bethlehem.

The condescension by the Almighty is then followed by Christ's ascension, which reveals the terrifying truth of our created purpose. For man is now lifted up beyond the holy of holies. And we begin to understand what it means to be made in the image and likeness of God.
Christ is our alpha and omega, our begining and end -- the power that completes our life in God.

!!! quote "Hebrews 2:8-10"
    Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.
    
    But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
     
    For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.



## The word made flesh

Christ is not a messenger from God, He is the message itself.
He is the revelation of divine truth.
He is revelation itself.
He is the logos, the divine word of God, in the form of man.
As such we can ascend with Him, and by looking upon Him do we see the face of God.

!!! quote "John 14:9"
    he that hath seen me hath seen the Father

... ineffable being of God

!!! quote "Matthew the Poor"
    Christ descends into His creation in order to raise it up to Himself. He does not transform into it but redeems it from within. He purposely takes His body from creation in order to unite with it, so that with that body, He may become partaker of creation's travails and death; but through the power of His divinity, He pulls it up from death by His resurrection and makes it co-heir with Him in glory.




## Father, Son, Holy Spirit

We learn from the life of Jesus that He is the Son of God, that the very word of God is itself a distinct person from God the Father. And that the bond between the Father and the Son, which proceeds from the Father to the Son, the very love of the Father to the Son, is the Holy Spirit, which is itself a distinct person.

The trinity is revealed to us in the life of Christ, that God Almighty is three persons -- which allows us to understand the transcendent source of all that is through relationships of eternal love. All fatherhood springs from God the Father, all sonship from Christ the word of God, and all life springs from the Holy Spirit -- which is the love from the Father to the Son.

Our very existence is an act of love, and through Christ can we understand the nature of the transcendent God, to understand the nature of love, the uncreated energy of God.




## Christ is knocking at your door

!!! quote "Revelation 3:20-21"
    Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.


!!! quote "John 8:12"
    I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.

The Spirit of Truth, The Lord of Spirits, God of gods, King of kings, Alpha and Omega, the Son of Man, the Son of God, the Messiah

## Temptations

three temptations, and we fall for them
 even today.


miracles, mystery, authority

We worship miracles, not God.
How easily tempted we are.

see Dostoevsky,
Brothers Karamazov 



"There is no possible event in life for which His grace is not sufficient."
Dr. Larry Crabb

"No situation is so desperate that God's grace is not sufficient."




## Meaning and Motivation

meaning in life is inescapable, and can be observed in three ways,

1. way of the slave - fear
2. way of the mercenary - reward
3. way of Christ - love

In other words, we can operate out of fear, fear of suffering, fear of death, fear of God if one is wise. This is our base motivation when all else fails. This is the one source of meaning we cannot escape.

And we can similarly operate out of reward, the mercenary mindset. We will seek reward and look for the shortest path to reward within the bounds of our fear of suffering.

Christ offers a third way, that of love, giving glory to God.









!!! quote "St. Joseph the Hesychast"
    Whatever we do not give to God to use in our ascetic struggles will be used by the other one (i.e., Satan). Our Lord gives us the commandment to love Him with all our souls and all our heart [Matthew 22:37], so that the evil one cannot find a place to rest within us.



!!! quote "Matthew 22:34-40"
    But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

If we are to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind then we are to give him everything that we are -- all our sins, all our talents, all our suffering, all our joys, everything. 
And even how we relate to others, we are to love our neighbors as ourselves.

This may seem impossible, and that's the point, we are called to something greater than ourselves. We are called to Christ, and by giving everything to Christ we become aware of the God-given grace that sustains us. We become aware of our part in His will, for His will be done.
We become the actuality of His triumph over sin and death.









## Theosis

To become like Christ

[metanoia](ancient-views/metanoia.md)

We sometimes refer to this relationship to God as familial, as a toddler to parent. A parent let's their toddler stumble about on its own will, while simultaneously being guided about by the parent's will, as they're the one's holding up their child as it tries to take its first few steps.

While similar, this is radically inverted from our relationship with God. A parent guides their child so that the child will become self reliant, and no longer need their parent in order to walk.

Yet our relationship with God means to ask and receive His help, and to let His will and our will become one. We are not aiming at growing stronger ourselves independent of God (as would our children), we are growing stronger due to a closer relationship with God, such that all things, our sins, our joys, everything -- are offered up to God and we receive His grace. Theosis, becoming like Christ, means necessarily to become more and more willfully dependent on God.



The life of Christ is not a series of miracles that Christians believe, nor is it a series of parables and moral advice, but it is a personal story that makes truth knowable to you, the story of your life as it was intended to be lived.
