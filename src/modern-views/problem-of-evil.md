# Philosophical Problem of Evil

In our modern conventional wisdom we sometimes hear about the philosopical problem of evil, usually something like,

> If God is all good, then why is there evil?

Interestingly, there are no religions with a philosophical problem of evil.

Dualistic religions typically offer a precosmogonic schism between dark and light, or in gnostic Christian sects they imagine a demiurge that is the source of evil.

Buddhism frames the entire cosmic drama in terms of suffering, illusion, and the cessation of suffering. There is no good or evil.
Hinduism similarly frames things outside of objective moral truth, ...

In fact, our entire notion of evil and good is based entirely on the God of the Bible. Where it is revealed that there is good and evil that are objectively knowable. And sin (missing the mark, turning away from God) is the source of evil.
In this view, evil has no substance, like darkness, it is merely the absence of light (of goodness).

Man and angels, fell from grace through pride, trying to "be as gods".
This introduced
 death
as well as shame (for without God we are naked, vulnerable, and will die).

In any proper understanding of Christianity, there is no problem of evil just like there is a philosophical problem of darkness.

> if God is the source of all light, why is there darkness?

No reasonable person would consider the philosophical problem of darkness to be a philosophical problem, so then why do so many 
"philosophers"
imagine that there is a philosophical problem of evil?




## Modern Deception 

Our modern mechanistic worldview imagines a philosophical problem of evil when trying to rationalize God in the face of their blatant sin, turning away from God and placing human reason in the place of God.

> ye shall be as gods

This is not a philosophical problem of evil, this is a philosophical problem of good. That is, why is there good in this universe? Why is there light and not complete darkness?

We exist with an intuitive sense of good and evil, objectively knowable good and evil.

Secular humanists have to explain why there is good. Why there is a "better" or a "progress" anywhere in their vocabulary. What is their aim in life without a universal and objectively knowable good?

Truth is, only the modern mechanistic view has this philosophical problem, for they cannot explain goodness, let alone evil. They project this onto Christianity. And the pathetic winsome milquetoast Christians fall for this, implicitly agreeing with an anti-Christian framing of their own faith, imagining that they have to answer this philosophical riddle, as if the burden of proof is on the Christian, rather than on the non-Christian to define what they even mean by good and evil.

If there is no objectively knowable good and evil, e.g., if it's all relativistic, then there's no philosophical problem because there's no such thing as good and evil. Yet of there's no such thing as good and evil, then why is morality (good and evil) implicit in our every perception. We cannot think or even reason without a good...



Any self-proclaimed Christian who believes there's a philosophical problem of evil is evidently not a Christian. The first few pages of the Bible provide a clear and profound philosophical understanding of the phenomena we call evil.

There is no philosophical problem. There is instead complete absurdity when and if we pretend there is such a philosophical problem.
