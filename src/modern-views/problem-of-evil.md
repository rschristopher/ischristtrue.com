# Philosophical Problem of Evil

In our modern view we sometimes hear about the philosopical problem of evil, usually something like,

> If God is so good, then why is there evil?

This is, however, a nonsensical debate. There are in fact no religions with a philosophical problem of evil.
For example,
dualistic religions typically claim a precosmogonic schism between dark and light, or even the gnostic sects imagine a demiurge that is the source of evil.
Buddhism frames the entire cosmic drama in terms of suffering, illusion, and nirvana. There is no good or evil.
Hinduism similarly frames things outside of any objective moral truth.

In fact, our entire concept of a knowable good and evil is based entirely on the God of the Bible. From Judaism it is revealed that there is a universal good and evil, and that it is objectively knowable. And sin (missing the mark, turning away from God) is the source of evil.
In this view, evil has no substance, like darkness, it is merely the absence of light (absence of goodness).

Man and angels both fell from grace through pride, trying to "be as gods".
This introduced
 eternal condemnation to those angels,
 and 
 death
 to man,
as well as shame (for without God we are naked, vulnerable, and we will most certainly die).
Judaism and Christianity provide a foundational view for good and evil.
In any proper understanding of God, there is no problem of evil just like there is no philosophical problem of darkness.

> if God created light, then why is there darkness?

No reasonable person would consider darkness to be a philosophical problem, so then why do so many 
"philosophers"
imagine that there is a philosophical problem of evil?




## Modern Deception 

Our modern worldview imagines a philosophical problem of evil when trying to rationalize God in the face of blatant sin, turning away from God and placing human reason in the place of God. 
In this view, we imagine ourselves as gods knowing good and evil. We want to keep our God-given abilities, our dominion over nature and all of creation -- we just want to dispense with God. Or as the snake in the garden promised,

> ye shall be as gods

In truth there is no such thing as a philosophical problem of evil, there is though a philosophical problem of good. That is, why is there good? Why is there light and not complete darkness? To answer this question is also to answer the nature of evil.

We exist with an intuitive sense of good and evil, objectively knowable good and evil.
Modern views must explain why there is good. Why there is a "better" or a "progress" anywhere in our vocabulary. What is our aim in life without a universal and objectively knowable good?
Even Nietzsche, as brilliant as he was, completely missed this point (what makes the *Ubermensch* better, and with what criteria do we define "better"?)

Truth is, only the modern rationalistic views have this philosophical problem, for they cannot explain goodness, let alone evil. They project this onto Christianity as a nihilistic attack. And the pathetically winsome milquetoast Christians fall for this false framing, implicitly agreeing with an anti-Christian view of their own faith, imagining that they have to answer this philosophical riddle, as if the burden of proof is on the Christian, rather than on the modern view to define what they even mean by good and evil.

If there is no objectively knowable good and evil, e.g., if it's all relativistic, then there's no philosophical problem because there's no such thing as good and evil. Yet if there's no such thing as good and evil, then why are good and evil implicit in our every perception? We cannot think or even reason without a good to attract our attention, and to contrast that good with its absence, that is, evil.



Any self-proclaimed Christian who believes there's a philosophical problem of evil is evidently not a believing Christian. The first few pages of the Bible provide a clear and profound philosophical understanding of the phenomena we call evil as well as its origin and the reason we are in this fallen state.

There is no philosophical problem. There is instead complete absurdity when and if we pretend there is such a philosophical problem.

What we have instead is knowledge of good and evil, and a moral law written into our hearts. We exist in this fallen state and despite our sin we are offered salvation and forgiveness.
