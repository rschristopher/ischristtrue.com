# Philosophical Problem of Evil

In our modern conventional wisdom we sometimes hear about the philosopical problem of evil, usually something like,

> If God is all good, then why is there evil?

Interestingly, despite all the debate, it is nonsensical and has no merit. There are in fact no religions with a philosophical problem of evil.

Dualistic religions typically claim a precosmogonic schism between dark and light, or in gnostic Christian sects they imagine a demiurge that is the source of evil.

Buddhism frames the entire cosmic drama in terms of suffering, illusion, and the cessation of suffering. There is no good or evil.
Hinduism similarly frames things outside of objective moral truth, ...

In fact, our entire notion of evil and good is based entirely on the God of the Bible. From Judaism it is revealed that there is good and evil, and that it is objectively knowable. And sin (missing the mark, turning away from God) is the source of evil.
In this view, evil has no substance, like darkness, it is merely the absence of light (absence of goodness).

Man and angels both fell from grace through pride, trying to "be as gods".
This introduced
 eternal condemnation to those angels,
 and 
 death
 to man,
as well as shame (for without God we are naked, vulnerable, and we will most certainly die).

In any proper understanding of Judaism or Christianity, there is no problem of evil just like there is no philosophical problem of darkness.

> if God created light, then why is there darkness?

No reasonable person would consider darkness to be a philosophical problem, so then why do so many 
"philosophers"
imagine that there is a philosophical problem of evil?




## Modern Deception 

Our modern mechanistic worldview imagines a philosophical problem of evil when trying to rationalize God in the face of their blatant sin, turning away from God and placing human reason in the place of God.

> ye shall be as gods

There is no such thing as a philosophical problem of evil, there is though a philosophical problem of good. That is, why is there good? Why is there light and not complete darkness?

We exist with an intuitive sense of good and evil, objectively knowable good and evil.

Secular humanists have to explain why there is good. Why there is a "better" or a "progress" anywhere in their vocabulary. What is their aim in life without a universal and objectively knowable good?
Even Nietzsche, as brilliant as he was, completely missed this point (what makes the Ubermensch better, and with what criteria do we define "better"?)

Truth is, only the modern rationalistic view has this philosophical problem, for they cannot explain goodness, let alone evil. They project this onto Christianity as a nihilistic attack. And the pathetic winsome milquetoast Christians fall for this false framing, implicitly agreeing with an anti-Christian view of their own faith, imagining that they have to answer this philosophical riddle, as if the burden of proof is on the Christian, rather than on the pagan to define what they even mean by good and evil.

If there is no objectively knowable good and evil, e.g., if it's all relativistic, then there's no philosophical problem because there's no such thing as good and evil. Yet if there's no such thing as good and evil, then why are good and evil implicit in our every perception? We cannot think or even reason without a good to attract our attention, and then to contrast that good with its absence, that is, evil.



Any self-proclaimed Christian who believes there's a philosophical problem of evil is evidently not a Christian. The first few pages of the Bible provide a clear and profound philosophical understanding of the phenomena we call evil.

There is no philosophical problem. There is instead complete absurdity when and if we pretend there is such a philosophical problem.

What we have instead is knowledge of good and evil, and a moral law written into our hearts.
