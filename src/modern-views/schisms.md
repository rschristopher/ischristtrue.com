There were many 
 [schisms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schism_in_Christianity) in early Christianity, usually from heretical movements that broke away from the church.
These heresies were often the impetus for ecumenical councils.

However, in 1054 the
  [great schism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_Schism)
  split East and West Christendom. 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the great schism fell roughly along the boundaries of the historic East and West Roman Empire.

Later, in the 16th century the
 [protestant reformation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation) started a continuous splintering in the west.
Despite theological arguments and objections, the protestant reformation was mostly along ethnic lines, succeeding in northern Europe (England, Germany, Netherlands, etc), with a few exceptions (such as Ireland).
This left the Roman Catholic Church dominant in southern Europe, notably within the boundaries of the romance languages (Italy, France, Spain, Portugal).

As such, Catholicism spread into Central and South America (colonies from Spain and Portugal), whereas Protestantism spread into North America (immigrants from northern Europe).
The splintering of protestantism continued such that there are now tens of thousands of different sects.
A modern protestant is likely to experience a schism at their own church, which are often anchored only by a specific pastor.

When someone says they are a Christian, what does that even mean?

As atheists are want to point out, it is as if the so-called "Christians" are arbitrarily picking and choosing passages from scriptures that adhere to their 
 [modern](index.md) secular worldview.
In other words, is it Christ or antichrist that we are following?

*One holy catholic and apostolic church* became many: protestant, Roman Catholic, and Orthodox churches.
How does one find Truth in this chaos?

On one hand, many protestants, Roman Catholics, and Orthodox agree on all the major issues of Christianity yet are in schism over theological and ecclesiological disagreements.

The *mere Christianity* approach by C.S. Lewis is popular amongst mainline protestants, but this doesn't quite help an honest Truth seeker.
If we choose whichever sect we "feel" is right we are giving in to self-worship and nihilism.
Truth is not found in our judgment, but in Christ.

!!! quote "John 6:68"
    Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.

If we are honest, we cannot go with any protestant church, doing so puts ourselves as judge over Christ.
We must seek the *one holy catholic and apostolic church*.
This leaves Roman Catholicism and Orthodox.



In year 1 of the great schism, 99.9% of Christians had no idea there was a schism. Even afterwards, entire generations had no idea. And those that did know assumed it would be resolved as [prior schisms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schism_in_Christianity) always were. When you're focused on Christ, the specifics of a temporary schism is not actually all that important. 

Because of this, we must concede that both are still His church. In fact, necessarily both were His church in the first thousand years. Other than getting muddier over time, did east or west at some point cease being His church?

Like the prodigal son, there were two sons, both were His sons, even when the younger left to waste his inheritance. He was lost, but he was still his father's son. And importantly, the older son who did not leave, he was rebuked after the prodigal son returned. Ultimately, both sons were in error.

One or both of the churches is necessarily in error. This is true of any schism. And while many schisms resulted in a failed sect, like the many Gnostic or Arian sects, East and West have both survived over a thousand years in schism. It is perhaps wise to look at both as being in error, and follow Christ obediently towards salvation.

Importantly, we as Christians cannot judge His church; truth is not decided by our judgement, but on His revelation and His judgment.
If "you decide" to be Catholic or Orthodox or protestant or whatever religion, you're choosing nihilism and not Christ. 

"you" do not determine truth. 

"you" can only rationalize beliefs. 

And your beliefs are irrelevant to truth, who is Christ Jesus.

We ought to discern carefully here, and we should proceed cautiously. Our goal is to follow Christ.

Are there heretical innovations that must necessarily be resolved in order to even begin discussing unification between east and west?

The Catholic answer, is maybe, and we have an instructive case of [Eastern Catholics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Catholic_Churches).

The Orthodox answer, is yes, absolutely there are many heretical innovations from Rome that must be resolved in order to unify, such as:

* filioque -- why was it added? What specific heresy is this guarding against? And why did the east not fall into that heresy without the filioque? Why was it added the way it was added?
* papal infallibility -- it did not exist for most of church history, was everyone wrong? what about the innovations of Vatican I, and Vatican II?

From a Catholic perspective, what would need to change about the Orthodox churches for them to unify? We can look at Eastern Catholics to get an idea. Not much changes, but they must grant authority to the pope, and hide internal divisions (such as we see within Catholicism right now but it never leads to schism, just inevitable protestantism).

When Orthodox churches fall out of communion with each other, it is not hidden, and typically they unify after differences are resolved, and often with a deeper articulation of Christian faith.
The schisms are ultimately a good and necessary feature of the church, the means to make public all differences that must be resolved before communion.

The goal is not vain unity, or any kind of unity. 
The goal is Christ. 
Do the divisions within Catholicism (starting at the great schism) point to Christ?
Do the divisions within Orthodoxy (starting at the great schism) point to Christ?
The answer, if we're being at all serious, is nuanced, and it's something like: Christ is the spirit of Truth, and He does not hide in darkness nor deceit.

if the Catholics are right, then they have to claim that the east "fell" and is in heresy -- but what did the east do? What about them is heretical?
Is it that they became "stuck" in the past? Can that even be a heresy?

Why was there not a protestant reformation in the east?
Protestantism and its continuous disintegration into different sects certainly seems to be the fruits of the scholastic innovations in Rome, fruits that were not seen in the east.

Lastly, if the goal is to commune with Christ, to come closer to Christ through His church, then why innovate? Would not the apostolic tradition be paramount above all else? Why change? 

And if there is change, is that not a tacit admission that everyone who came before, every saint, was wrong or naive? And wouldn't this necessarily include Peter?

Would Peter agree with Rome's claim of the infallibility of his teaching as head of the church? 
Did not Paul once rebuke Peter? 
Did not Christ himself rebuke Peter many times?

And if infallible, why would that come later? Is the successor to Peter only infallible in modern times?
Peter also founded the church at Antioch, is Peter's successor in Antioch infallible?
Why only the successor in Rome is infallible?

Most important, what heresy is being done by Eastern Orthodox? How are they wrong today yet we're right in the first thousand years of church history?

There have been many abuses in east and west Christianity, but taking them at their best by their own standard, what is the heresy of Eastern Orthodox?
And, what exactly is the standard of Rome at its best? Does that standard include innovations that Rome itself would have considered heretical for its first thousand years?

All things considered, it looks an awful lot like Rome is in heresy, in schism from Christ, and Eastern Orthodoxy is waiting patiently, "stuck" in the past as it were, waiting and waiting and waiting for the prodigal son of Rome to return home. 

Or perhaps, Orthodox are like the older son to the prodigal son, and as such they will receive the Father's rebuke.

As Christians we ought to follow Christ, who taught us the story of the prodigal son, and we ought to identify ourselves and our church with the prodigal son and also with the older brother.
We ought to return home, and we ought to be grateful that he was lost is now found.
