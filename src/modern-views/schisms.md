A *schism* is simply a split in a religious or political organization. And in order to understand the shallow worldliness of [modern Christianity](christianity.md) it can be instructive to understand the historic and ongoing schisms within Christianity.

In other words, how did we get here? And how do we discern the truth that is Christ Jesus?



## Brief History 

There were many 
 [schisms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schism_in_Christianity) in early Christianity, usually from heretical movements that broke away from the church.
These heresies were often the impetus for ecumenical councils.

    ...

However, in 1054 the
 [great schism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_Schism)
 split East and West Christendom.
Importantly, for over a thousand years Christianity remained a unified worldview and is what is meant by *Orthodox Christianity*.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the *great schism* fell roughly along the boundaries of the historic East and West Roman Empire.

    As Christianity spread into the Roman empire, it became divided between East and West (first by [Diocletian](https://www.worldhistory.org/Diocletian/), and later the empire was temporarily reunited by [Constantine](https://www.worldhistory.org/Constantine_I/) who converted to Christianity and moved the capital away from old Rome and into [Byzantium](https://www.worldhistory.org/Byzantium/) which would later be renamed [Constantinople](https://www.worldhistory.org/Constantinople/). 
    
    Eastern Rome became known as the [Byzantine Empire](https://www.worldhistory.org/Byzantine_Empire/) which would continue the Roman empire (now as a Christian empire) for over a thousand years (the longest living empire in the history of the world).

    Prior to the great schism, the western remnants of the fallen Western Rome would unite into the [Holy Roman Empire](https://www.worldhistory.org/Holy_Roman_Empire/), and by 1054 the east and west [officially](https://www.britannica.com/event/East-West-Schism-1054) excommunicated each other.

Later, in the 16th century the
 [protestant reformation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation) started a continuous splintering within the decaying Holy Roman Empire.
Despite specific theological objections, the protestant reformation was mostly along ethnic lines, succeeding in northern Europe (England, Germany, Netherlands, etc) with a notable exception of Ireland which stayed Catholic.
This left the Roman Catholic Church dominant in southern Europe, notably within the boundaries of the romance languages (Italy, France, Spain, Portugal).

Along these schismatic lines, Roman Catholicism spread into Central and South America (colonies from Spain and Portugal), whereas Protestantism spread into North America (immigrants from northern Europe).
In fact many of the early settlers into the north-American colonies were escaping religious persecution (such as the various [anabaptist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabaptism) sects).

This splintering of protestantism never ceased and continues now into our modern age. 
There are now tens of thousands of different "Christian" sects.
In fact, a modern protestant is likely to experience a schism even at their own local church, which are usually anchored only by a popular pastor.
It's important to understand that this splintering is a continuation of the great schism of 1054 and feeds into the continuous destructive revolutions of our [modern worldview](index.md).

## Seeking Truth

In the midst of these continuous schisms, when someone says they are a Christian, what does that even mean?

As atheists are want to point out, it is as if the so-called "Christians" are arbitrarily picking and choosing passages from scriptures that adhere to their 
 [modern](index.md) secular worldview.
In other words, is it Christ or antichrist that we are following?

*One holy catholic and apostolic church* has ostensibly become many: protestant, Roman Catholic, and Orthodox churches.
How does one find Truth in this chaos?







### Protestantism 

On one hand, most Christians agree completely on all the major issues of Christianity and are only in schism over some theological and ecclesiological disagreements.
This *mere Christianity* approach by C.S. Lewis is popular amongst mainline protestants, but this doesn't quite help an honest Truth seeker.
If we choose whichever protestant church we "feel" is right are we not giving in to self-worship and nihilism?
Truth is not found in our judgment, but in Christ.

!!! quote "John 6:68"
    Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.

If we are honest, we cannot go with any protestant church, doing so puts ourselves as judge over Christ and His words.

And perhaps the most troubling aspect of modern protestantism is the continued schisms.
In a protestant worldview, my own personal interpretation of scripture is as valid as any.
This is fine for a secular worldview, but this is to turn our back on Christ Himself.

And even if you were to find a pious protestant church, how long till that church falls into blatant heresy?
How many churches today have founders that would war against their modern members? Remember that the reformers would put to death anabaptists, and yet today "believers baptism" has become the norm in many reformed churches.

We must seek the *one holy catholic and apostolic church*.





### Catholicism

The word *catholic* simply means *universal*, and note that the [creed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed) refers to *one holy catholic and apostolic church*.
Modern Catholicism refers specifically to the presumed authority of the former Holy Roman Empire.

This was not always the case, prior to the great schism there was *one holy catholic and apostolic church* in both east and west.

In fact, in year 1 of the great schism, most all Christians had no idea there was a schism. Even afterwards, entire generations had no idea. And those that did know assumed it would be resolved as [prior schisms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schism_in_Christianity) always were. When you're focused on Christ, the specifics of a temporary schism is not actually all that important. 

Because of this, we must concede that both modern Catholicism has a strong claim to be the original church. In fact, necessarily both east and west were Christ's church in the first thousand years. Other than getting muddier over time, did east or west at some point cease being His church?

Like the prodigal son, there were two sons, both were His sons, even when the younger left to waste his inheritance. He was lost, but he was still his father's son. And importantly, the older son who did not leave, he was rebuked after the prodigal son returned. Ultimately, both sons were in error.

One or both sides of the great schism is necessarily in error. This is true of any schism. And while many schisms resulted in a failed sect, like the many Gnostic or Arian sects, East and West have both survived over a thousand years while in schism. They both are the remnants of long-lived empires, and both empires have fallen. It is perhaps wise to look at both as being in error, and follow Christ obediently towards salvation.

Importantly, we as Christians cannot judge His church; truth is not decided by our judgement, but on His revelation and His judgment.
If "you" decide to be Catholic or Orthodox or protestant, you're choosing nihilism and not Christ. 

"you" do not determine truth. 

"you" can only rationalize beliefs. 

And your beliefs are irrelevant to truth, who is Christ Jesus.

We ought to discern carefully here, and we should proceed cautiously. Our goal is to follow Christ and not antichrist.

Are there heretical innovations that must necessarily be resolved in order to even begin discussing unification between east and west?

The Catholic answer, is maybe, and we have an instructive case of [Eastern Catholics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Catholic_Churches).

The Orthodox answer, is yes, absolutely there are many heretical innovations from Rome that must be resolved in order to unify, such as:

* filioque -- why was it added? What specific heresy is this guarding against? And why did the east not fall into that heresy without the filioque? Why was it added the way it was added?
* papal infallibility -- it did not exist for most of church history, was everyone wrong? what about the innovations of Vatican I, and Vatican II?

From a Catholic perspective, what would need to change about the Orthodox churches for them to unify? We can look at Eastern Catholics to get an idea. Not much changes, but they must grant authority to the pope.
Unification according to Roman Catholicism is thus not about Christ, but about the pope.


Would Peter agree with Rome's claim of the infallibility of his teaching as head of the church? 
Did not Paul once rebuke Peter? 
Did not Christ himself rebuke Peter many times?

And if infallible, why would that come later? Is the successor to Peter only infallible in modern times?

Peter also founded the church at Antioch, which is today an Orthodox Church. Is Peter's successor in Antioch infallible?
Why only the successor in western Rome after it's collapse, is considered infallible?




### Orthodoxy

When Orthodox churches fall out of communion with each other, it is not hidden or resolved by a pope, and they unify after differences are resolved, and often with a deeper articulation of Christian faith.
The schisms are ultimately a good and necessary feature of the church, the means to make public all differences that must be resolved before communion.

The goal is not vain unity, or any kind of unity. 
The goal is Christ. 
Do the divisions within Catholicism (starting at the great schism) point to Christ?
Do the divisions within Orthodoxy (starting at the great schism) point to Christ?
The answer, if we're being at all serious, is nuanced, and it's something like: Christ is the spirit of Truth, and He does not hide in darkness nor deceit.

If the Catholics are right, then they have to claim that the east "fell" and is in heresy -- but what did the east do? What about them is heretical?
Is it that they became "stuck" in the past? Can that even be a heresy?

Why was there not a protestant reformation in the east?
Protestantism and its continuous disintegration into different sects certainly seems to be the fruits of the scholastic innovations in Rome, fruits that were not seen in the east.

Lastly, if the goal is to commune with Christ, to come closer to Christ through His church, then why innovate? Would not the apostolic tradition be paramount above all else? Why change? 

And if there was necessary change, is that not a tacit admission that everyone who came before, every saint, was wrong or naive? And wouldn't this necessarily include Peter?



Most important, what heresy is being done by Eastern Orthodox? How are they wrong today yet were right in the first thousand years of church history?

There have been many abuses in east and west Christianity, but let's take them at their own standard, what is the heresy of Eastern Orthodox?
And, what exactly is the standard of Rome at its best? Does that standard include innovations that Rome itself would have considered heretical for its first thousand years?

All things considered, it looks an awful lot like Rome is in heresy, in schism from Christ, and Eastern Orthodoxy is waiting patiently, "stuck" in the past as it were, waiting and waiting and waiting for the prodigal son of Rome to return home. 

Or perhaps, Orthodox Churches are like the older son to the prodigal son, and as such they will receive the Father's rebuke.

As Christians we ought to follow Christ, who taught us the story of the prodigal son, and we ought to identify ourselves and our church with the prodigal son and also with the older brother.
We ought to return home, and we ought to be grateful and celebrate when one returns home to the Father.
