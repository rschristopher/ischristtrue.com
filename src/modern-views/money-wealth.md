good money, from God ... how to discern good money from sin? light vs darkness, know them by their fruits 

We are created to work, for God could have created everything in a single instant with but a word, instead He worked for six days and on the seventh He rested. The nature of work is fundamental to creation, including planning, ordering, and rest. That is the nature of reality as He created it.

Despite the fall of man, work itself is good. Man's purpose is to work, and to work in a way that glorifies God by willfully participating in His will.

Money is a technology, a social technology that allows for one person to save and then use that saved money to direct the work of others. 

What makes a money good and not sinful? Money is good when it is produced through work, work that glorifies God. This means that money cannot be used as a system of control. God gave us free will so that we may come to him willfully, so that our God-given will can participate in His divine will.

Good money is the fruit of good work, and it belongs to God (as all things do). It is never your money, never your wealth, but it is in your possession as a steward; God has granted you the responsibility to lead and direct the work of others. Such an awesome responsibility is a blessing and a temptation -- a certain snake will whisper his familiar line, that "ye shall be as gods".

But it is God's sovereignty. It is His money. If you confuse it with yours then this is to give in to the serpent. This is where the rich falls to pride, and the poor to envy.

Shoulder the burden responsibly, knowing it is God's money no matter where it goes, abd that it is in your hands for a reason, that you have been tasked by God. If you find yourself with money, pray for wisdom sufficient for such a challenge.


work, proof of work 

the desert, life post fiat (Pharoah)
