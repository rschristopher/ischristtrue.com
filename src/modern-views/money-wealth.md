# Money and Wealth

Money as we know it did not exist in the ancient world, and in fact "money" as we understand it today did not exist even 60 years ago.

Trying to understand what any ancient text has to say about money is like trying to decipher ancient opinions about the Internet.
What gets translated as "money" in ancient texts was not what we think in terms of modern money -- unless by "money" you were thinking of a herd of sheep, or maybe ornamental metals.

The very nature of modern "money" is itself deeply immoral and functionally [broken](https://isbitcointrue.com/bitcoin-as-money/money-and-state/).
Moreover, the Biblical warnings about the love of money have become all the more relevant.

!!! quote "1 Timothy 6:20"
    For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.








## Modern Money

What we call "money" today is no longer based on wealth or even symbols of wealth -- there is no livestock or precious metals backing our "money".

In the aftermath of the infamous [Nixon shock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock) of [1971](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/)
 -- money as we understood it died along with the last [remnants of the gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system).
Money became a self-ascribed "free-floating currency" based on credit and debt from central banks.
In practice, this is a euphemistic description of "fiat money", itself a euphemism for an immoral system of debt slavery, 
 where "money" is simply nominal valuations of goods and services, literally by fiat.

!!! warning "Central Planners and Fiat"
    While central bankers may decry the historic catastrophes of modern [socialist experiments](socialism.md), they are effectively part of the same problem. Central banking is simply a more insidious and effective form of central planning. 
    
    Rather than attempt to control prices by fiat as the communists unsuccessfully attempted, central bankers attenpt to control money by fiat, including -- and by their [own admission](https://www.bis.org/press/p220621.htm) -- control of what can be purchased (and by whom).
    So-called [know your customer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) regulations and other privacy-invasive laws
    attempt to control who can buy and sell, and what can be bought and sold.

In truth, modern "money" in a bank account is simply a debt token,
 valued by the decree of unaccountable central bankers,
 who can print or expand their "money" supply, literally by fiat.
And they can decide (again by fiat) who can use their debt tokens.

Note that inflating a money supply does not add additional value, obviously, but rather devalues the money, all by fiat
 -- effectively stealimg from everyone else (the debt slaves).

Fiat money, by any reasonable account, is theft of value,
 taking advantage of the implicit trust people have in their own government and financial institutions. 
We naively assume fiat money is wealth (the ancient understanding of money), and thus willingly participate in a system of debt slavery,
 serving a ruling class of demonstrably incompetent and unaccountable bureaucrats.

Worse still, and despite "good intentions",
 any attempt to control money is an attempt at a kind of *total-totalitarianism*,
 where bureaucrats have complete control of the people using their fiat money.
This not only makes an idol out of money, but it is technically impossible (as money is not something that can be controlled by fiat).

One cannot actually control money. Money must function as a measurement of the subjective values of participants in a given market
 (that is, prices in markets)
 -- controlling money requires control of people's subjective feelings of value (which change from moment-to-moment). 
You can force someone to obey, but you cannot force their heart. 
We cannot even force subjective feelings upon ourselves, let alone on others.

Despite what central planners believe, they are not gods, and rationalized good intentions do not control reality. 
There is only one God, and we are His creation, made in His image and likeness.


!!! quote "Matthew 6:19-21"
    Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.


















## Modern Wealth

Godly money

honest weights and measures

work, proof of work 

the desert, life post fiat (Pharoah)

if Bitcoin is true we will know it (as Pharoah knew the truth of the Lord).

good money is and can only be from God.

Fiat money is not from God. It is from man, from systems of control, allowed by God but not from God, as all evil is. 
It is money created ex-nihilo by man, confusing man with God. 
Even fiat central bankers will tell you that money is a shared illusion,
 and as such they imagine themselves as in control of the narratives that control the illusion.
It is at best a deceptive spell.

Is Bitcoin from God? Is it more like gold or like fiat? 
Bitcoin is peculiar in that it is backed by cryptography, by mathematics, and requires proof-of-work for both issuance and transaction settlement. 
Gold requires work for issuance only, no work is explicitly required for transaction settlement
 (though it implicitly requires massive work to secure any transfer and verification of gold). 
Fiat requires no work for either. 

Arguably, if we see that God is the author of this universe,
 and the author of the mathematical laws that we can discover in order to better understand the universe,
 then Bitcoin is from God in the most profound sense.

Another way to think about it, acts-of-God can cause the loss of gold, of Bitcoin, but not of fiat. 
After an act of God more fiat can be and is created. 
The supply of fiat is limited only by central planners, and not by God (at least not explicitly). 
Meanwhile, the laws of mathematics (the word of God) limit the supply of Bitcoin.

Work is God-given and pure, existing before the fall. 
Proof-of-work for transaction settlement is a harder money than gold in every possible sense. 
The incentives for mining will be in part due to the desire for transaction settlement itself. 
Financial sovereigns will mine not just for profit, the margins will be too slim over time,
 but they will mine so that they can guarantee that their transactions can be settled without counterparty.

Gold does not provide proof-of-work for transaction settlement (including securing gold),
 hence the hidden cost of settlement is born out in physical security of transferring gold.
Bitcoin includes proof-of-work for transaction settlement,
 and in fact this is incorporated into issuance (money production). 
The same work backs both. 
Should these have been separate? 
Would a separate proof-of-work for transaction settlement be beneficial? 
Or is it necessary to include them together? 
By including them together, it provides the minimum proof-of-work necessary for the monetary system to sustain.

























## Stewardship

https://publicorthodoxy.org/2022/11/01/christian-stewardship-and-wealth/

> Ultimately, all of us act merely as stewards of God’s wealth. Thus, Jesus teaches us all to confess, “We are unprofitable servants. We have [only] done what was our duty to do” (Luke 17:10)

https://www.oca.org/the-hub/the-church-on-current-issues/an-orthodox-understanding-of-stewardship

> stewardship, literally refers to the management of a household. Stewardship is a task, a responsibility bestowed on one person by another - usually by a master.


https://www.focusonthefamily.com/family-qa/biblical-principles-and-perspectives-about-money/

> What does a good steward look like? We’d suggest that there are five key indicators of the faithfulness with which he’s carrying out his responsibilities. First, he gives generously in proportion with the level of his resources and abilities (2 Corinthians 8:12). Second, he exercises self-control by maintaining a debt-free lifestyle (Romans 13:8; Galatians 5:23. Third, he pays his taxes with integrity and an attitude of thanksgiving (Matthew 22:21; Romans 13:7). Fourth, he sets financial goals with an eye to the needs of his family and loved ones (1 Timothy 5:8). And fifth, he seeks the counsel of wise advisors and remains accountable to others in all his financial dealings (Proverbs 15:22).


good money, from God ... how to discern good money from sin? light vs darkness, know them by their fruits 






A steward works.
We are created to work. 
God could have created everything in a single instant with but a word, instead He worked for six days and on the seventh day He rested. 
The nature of work is fundamental to creation itself, including planning, ordering, and rest. 
That is the nature of reality as He created it. 
And He saw that it was good.

Despite the fall of man, work itself is good. 
Man's purpose is to work, to work in such a way as to glorify God, participating in His will.

Money is a technology, a social technology that allows for one person to save and then use that saved money to direct and influence the work of others. 
Simply by participating in a market, one is valuing some goods and services over others. 
And it is in this influence that the morality of money and wealth can be seen, both in money production and usage.

What makes a money good and not sinful? 
Money is good when it is produced through work, work that glorifies God. 
This means that money cannot be used as a system of control. 
God gave us free will so that we may come to him willfully, so that our God-given will can participate in His divine will.

Good money is the fruit of good work, and it belongs to God (as all things do). 
It is never your money, never your wealth, but it is in your possession temporarily, and you are a steward for God's wealth;
 God has granted you the responsibility to lead and influence the work of others. 
Such an awesome responsibility is a blessing and a temptation
 -- where a certain snake will whisper his familiar line, that "ye shall be as gods".

Good money must also be *produced* through good work. 
That is, money production must be good, it must glorify God.

And it is God's sovereignty. 
It is His money. 
If you confuse it with yours then this is to give in to the serpent. 
This is where the rich man falls to pride, and the poor man to envy.

!!! quote "[St John Climacus](https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2016/04/st-john-climacus-on-love-of-money-or.html?m=1)"
    The sins of the rich, such as greed and selfishness, are obvious for all to see. The sins of the poor are less conspicuous, yet equally corrosive of the soul. Some poor people are tempted to envy the rich; indeed this is a form of vicarious greed, because the poor person wanting great wealth is in spirit no different from the rich person amassing great wealth. Many poor people are gripped by fear: their hearts are caught in a chain of anxiety, worrying whether they will have food on their plates tomorrow or clothes on their backs. Some poor people are constantly formulating in their minds devious plans to cheat the rich to obtain their Wealth; this is no different in spirit from the rich making plans to exploit the poor by paying low wages. The art of being poor is to trust in God for everything, to demand nothing-and to be grateful for all that is given.


Shoulder the burden of wealth responsibly, knowing it is God's money no matter where it goes,
 and that it is in your hands for a reason, that you have been tasked by God. 
If you find yourself with money, pray for wisdom sufficient for such a challenge. 
Your salvation is on the line.


















## Tithing

Tithing means literally *one tenth*, and in our modern view we view this as 10% of ones gross income given to the church.

In the early church, tithing was adopted from Jewish tradition which involved three tithes,

1. annual tithe to the priests
2. annual feast tithe to the temple 
3. 3rd year tithe to the poor

These practices and the history of tithing goes back centuries before the mosaic law, with the earliest biblical references of Abraham giving a tithe to Melchizedek,

!!! quote "Genesis 14:18-20"
    And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
    
    And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
    
    And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

In this context Abram gives a tenth of all he possessed, an offering to the God most high. It is a callback to Abel's offering of the firstlings of his flock,

!!! quote "Genesis 4:4"
    And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering

Meanwhile Cain offered "of the fruit of the ground" and the Lord "had no respect". We can discern that Cain did not offer the firstfruits.

This sets a pattern of setting aside the finest of our work to give to God. And then in the time of Israel tithings were codified in law.

And while it is tempting to treat these laws as prophecies fulfilled and no longer applicable, the truth from the apostles and early church fathers is contrary, rather than a tithe (tenth) all was given, for we are but stewards of the wealth and all must be given up to God.

In the history of the early church tithing went from common to non-existent, and at different periods in history re-emerged. Tithing became more common in the west, especially by the time of the reformation.

The truth, the sprit is to be good stewards, to offer up to Christ all that you have: your work, your wealth, everything. All is from God and the Christian gives gladly all.

In practical terms this seems impossible, but this impossibility should speak not of an error in the Biblical understanding of giving and stewardship, but of a lack of true faith in one's church. Either you are holding your wealth away from God, or you do not believe your church is the true church of Christ.

If we met Christ resurrected, would we not sell everything we own and give to His church? 
What if it was the apostle Paul, or Peter? 
And what does it mean to offer up everything we own to Christ?

Does it mean we trust the priests to manage wealth and meet our needs? 
Or do we manage that ourselves? 
What is expected of us?

!!! quote "Luke 12:48"
    For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.
