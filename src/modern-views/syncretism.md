Is everyone worshipping the same God?

In short, no.

Second temple Judiasm is the soil from which Christianity emerged -- in other words, where Christ was born, died, rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven, ruling creation in the midst of his enemies.

The Logos incarnate

Not Judiasm, nor Islam...
Judiasm denies that Jesus is the Christ.
Islam denies that Christ is God.



!!! quote "1 John 2:23"
    Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also.



This can be a rather difficult topic, as we're forced into the uncomfortable proposition that all other beliefs are not just wrong but also heretical and blasphemous.


The closest we get to syncretism in orthodox Christianity is the revelation that the other "gods" are created beings, thus not "gods" by any reasonable definition.
For example, Himduism is not worshipping the same God, but rather they are worshipping demons, created and fallen spirits.

What about heterodox Christians?
They worship the same God but incorrectly?
Or do they worship the antichrist?
