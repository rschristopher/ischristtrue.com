Is everyone worshipping the same God?

In short, no.

Second temple Judiasm is the soil from which Christianity emerged -- in other words, where Christ was born, died, and rose.
Not Judiasm, nor Islam...
Judiasm denies that Jesus is the Christ.
Islam denies that Christ is God.

The Logos incarnate


!!! quote "1 John 2:23"
    Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also.



This can be a rather difficult topic, as we're forced into the uncomfortable proposition that all other beliefs are not just wrong but also heretical and blasphemous.
