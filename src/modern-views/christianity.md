# Modern Christianity

Modern Christianity is often maligned, including by Christians.






## They Followed Him

!!! quote "Matthew 4:18-22"
    And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.
    And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.
    
    And they straightway left their nets, and **followed him**.

    And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.

    And they immediately left the ship and their father, and **followed him**.


!!! quote "Matthew 19:16-24"
    And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

    And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.

    He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
    Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

    The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?
    Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and ***follow me***.

    But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.

    Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.
    And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.


!!! quote "Luke 9:57-62"
    And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
    And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.
    
    And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
    Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.
    
    And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.
    And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.


!!! quote "Acts 2:44-47"
    And all that believed were together, and had all things common; 
    And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. 
    And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, 
    Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.






## Desert/Wilderness

!!! quote "Revelation 13:17"
    And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. And to the woman were given **two wings of a great eagle**, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

!!! quote "Exodus 19:3-6"
    And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how **I bare you on eagles' wings**, and brought you unto myself. Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.

The true home is the desert, the wilderness...




## Modern Churches

Imagine a man who sold everything and went to his local church, showing up at the door and telling the church staff, "I have sold everything I own, and now I am here to follow Christ".

It's easy to imagine a modern church would happily take this man's money, but would they open their doors to this man outside of Sunday? 
If he refused to leave and stayed in the parking lot, praying day and night, what would the staff of a modern Christian church do? 

How many would call the police or social services? For clearly by our [modern view](index.md) such a man would not be in his right mind. 

By doing so is this not clear evidence of where such a church places God in their hierarchy of belief, beneath the power of the state? 



And here's an easier question: would you give everything you own to your church and trust that they would look after you, distributing your money to all according to need?
Or do you fear they would mismanage your money?
Even if you recognized that you are but a steward of any wealth acquired, and that it is God's wealth at the end of the day -- would you then trust your church with this wealth?
They would certainly ask for a tithing, but why only 10% and not everything? If they are the true church of Christ do they not deserve everything? If they are not the true church of Christ then why does a false church deserve anything?

Is not such fear and uncertaintly evidence that you most likely do not believe your church is the true church of Christ? And by asking for only a tithing is that not evidence that they themselves do not believe they are the true church of Christ?

It is no wonder that cults emerge and people give everything to some charismatic leader, for we are all worshipping something, and how many modern Christians are worshipping the state and mammon over Christ Jesus?

For if you found the true church and believed it was indeed the true church, you would give them everything, you would follow exactly as Christ instructed.

I submit that we are all in search for the true church, and we give according to our faith in such -- and as weak as our faith may be, we pray to find the true church of Christ.










## The True Church?

Many will claim to be the true church of Christ.
Many will claim that other churches are in fact, not the true church of Christ.

Many will claim that the true church is invisible.
The physical buildings then are not the true church.
And usually that shows.
