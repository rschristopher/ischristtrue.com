# Modern Views

What is the modern view -- the spirit of our time -- or rather, *who* is the spirit of our time?

If you ask around you'll get different answers; some will talk of secularism, humanism, cultural "progress" and various political narratives. Others will talk of reactionary views to counter the revolutionary views. And still others will talk of despair, that something is clearly wrong with the modern world. 

Yet they all speak of the same spirit:
that we are at the verge of something new, a coming singularity, and life will never be the same.
From transhumanism to the sovereign individual thesis to the age of Aquarius, there is apparently a coming revolution, an awakening, an emergence, a new age. We are nearing a pivotal moment in history -- if not *the* pivotal moment in history, redefining what it even means to have a history.
We are apparently witnessing the destruction of the old order, which is necessary for the "new" age to come.

This destructive revolution is the modern view.

The irony of course is that this modern "revolution" is not new. We've been at the dawning of a new age, the destruction of the old order, for quite some time now.
The new age never seems to fully manifest, and to the degree it does it quickly becomes the old and all attention switches to the truly "new", the real revolution. It's always promised to be happening soon if not now.

In truth, it is but the failure of every generation, the echoes of man's original sin reverberating through the ages. But let's trace this destructive revolutionary view back, and see if we can find where it started.




## Where did this start?

Conventional wisdom will tell you this view started in the 1960s, the counterculture revolution, the start of the culture war.
That's the story we often hear, especially in the United States.
And there seems to be something to this, as there was a seismic shift in western culture, a rejection of past social norms, the start of the civil rights movement, Roe v Wade, Woodstock --
certainly it seems as if the culture prior to the famed hippy generation was distinctly different from everything that came afterwards.

And yet, hindsight being 20/20, the fruits of that generation can be known. There was an Altamont to every Woodstock, reactions to every revolution. The few years of the late 1960s counterculture gave way to the decadence and degeneracy that marked the following decades.
And despite the abysmal failures on every front, what we can see clearly is that the 1960s were the start of a parasitism in institutions starting with academia and then into political and corporate entities, degrading and weakening families and undermining the foundations of civilization. We now see the normalization of relativism, an assault on truth itself.
In fact, since the 1960s this parasitism has spread globally, and noticeably accelerated. Every generation now feels they are at the verge of a new revolution, where their struggles will be the ones that mark the coming of something new. 

"Be on the right side of history", they'll tell you, as they imagine they are making the world a better place at this "pivotal" moment in history.
Whether it's a climate catastrophe, a population bomb, nuclear war -- it is an existential crisis and the old world must die no matter the cost.
And yet the consequences of their actions prove the opposite even by their own naive moral standards.
This is the spirit of our time, and while it has now festered into a global parasitism, we can go urther back if we want to find where it began.

Let's consider the second world war, with concentration camps and genocide. Without a doubt this completely reshaped the world and was a definitive end of the old world, the beginning of the new.
Hundreds of millions of dead, more death than the world had ever seen in just a handful of years.
An atomic bomb, the beginning of a nuclear arms race.

The entirety of the 1960s counterculture seems rather insignificant compared to the second world war.
Perhaps this is the better starting point of our modern view, a post war view.

And yet, Stalin and Hitler did not happen in a vacuum. The bloodshed of the 20th century was clearly the consequence of socialist experiments, from national socialism to communism.
Marxism clearly articulates this destructive revolution, albeit in socio-economic terms.
Even at the end of the short-lived Nazi regime, Goebbels himself viewed this in familiar Marxist revolutionary terms,

> Together with the monuments of culture there crumble also the last obstacles to the fulfillment of our revolutionary task. Now that everything is in ruins, we are forced to rebuild Europe. In the past, private possessions tied us to a bourgeous restraint. Now the bombs, instead of killing all Europeans have only smashed the prison walls which kept them captive. In trying to destroy Europe’s future, the enemy has only succeeded in smashing its past; and with that, everything old and outworn has gone.

Marxism is but one of the many outbursts of the modern view, the spirit of our time.
And we can trace this back further; into the soil from which the socialist experiments grew; and it is here we find the mad prophet Nietzsche,

> It may be that I am the first
> to light upon an idea which will
> divide the history of mankind in two.

> all who are born after us
> belong to a higher history
> than any history hitherto.

You'll be hard pressed to find a better articulation of the modern view than this. And yet Dostoyevsky manages it beautifully, and prior to Nietzsche.

> Everything will be new... 
> then they will divide history
> into two parts:
>  from the gorilla to the 
>  annihilation of God,
>  and from the annihilation of God
>  to the transformation of the earth,
>  and of man physically.
> 
> ~ Krillov in The Possessed
> by Dostoyevsky

Very clearly, we can trace the origin of the modern view back to the 1800s, to the prescience of Dostoyevsky in the east and Nietzsche in the west.

In a frightfully prophetic view, Nietzsche (in Will to Power) writes,
> What I am describing here is the history of the twentieth century, the triumph of Nihilism, because when the masses get the ideas which I am now proclaiming, there will be a revolution such as the world has never seen.



 
 
> Shall we not ourselves have to become gods merely to seem worthy of it (the death of God)?
> 
> ~ Nietzsche 

"Dead are all the gods. Now do we desire the Superman to live.”

And Kirillov in The Possessed says: “If there is no God, then I am God.”

Dostoyevsky distinguishes between the God-man Jesus Christ and the man-god, the new being who is coming up from the earth to become god.

Zarathustra says:
> I bring you a goal; I preach to you the Superman. Man is something to be overcome. What have you done to overcome him? All things before you have produced something beyond themselves, and would you be the ebb of this great flood? Would you rather go back to the animal than transcend man? What is  the ape to man? A jest or a bitter shame. And just that shall man be to the Superman, a jest or a bitter shame. You have traveled the way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.... Lo, I preach to you the Superman. The Superman is the meaning of the earth.

... and Hitler believed himself to be so.


And yet these exact ideas go back even further, into the reign of terror of the French Revolution.

> The period before 1789 was called the “Old Regime,” and the period after that is the “Revolutionary Age” which is the same now as it was in the 1790’s.

...

In fact, you'll find a clear lineage from the time of Robespierre and the atrocities of the French revolution, all the way to Hitler and the atrocities of the second world war, and then all the way forward to the present day to our nihilistic meaning crisis.

We can further trace the modern view back
 before the enlightenment,
 tracing through the 
 [Copernican revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution)
 and further back into
 the age of 
 [scholasticism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholasticism),
 all the way to the
 [great schism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East%E2%80%93West_Schism).
Century after century, each generation has been trying to destroy the old and usher in a revolution, a final revolution -- a decided pivot in history.

https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/norman-cohn-the-pursuit-of-the-millennium

For example the 
[Joachimites](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachimites)
in the 13th century imagined three ages, and that they were entering the 3rd and final age.

> revolutionary conclusions were drawn later by men of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, by the Franciscan Spirituals, who recognized in Joachim the new John the Baptist, heralding St. Francis at the novus dux of the last dispensation, even as the "new Christ".






## Was it always like this?

The short answer: no, not at all. A continuous destructive revolution was unheard of outside of western Europe and it's unique cultural influence. This was not the view of eastern Europe nor of eastern Christianity nor any major religion. This was not the view of the Byzantine Empire. This was not the view in the Ottoman empire. This was not the view in any of the historic dynasties of China. 
This was not the view of any native American culture prior to the arrival of western Europeans.
None of the 
 [ancient views](../ancient-views/)
 resembled this nihilistic path of
 continuous revolution and relativism.
This is a unique worldview born of western Christianity post schism, with notably anti-Christian themes (as it emerged as an antithesis to Christianity). And yet today this view has been exported globally and has become the defacto modern globalist view.

We can find hints of this view sprinkled throughout history. To the degree it emerged in early Christianity it was also condemned and anathematized. It only actualized into a continuous (albeit parasitic) ethos after the great schism, emerging from the early scholastic movement and coming into fruition by the enlightenment era.





## Christian Antithesis 

In a perverse and deceitful twist, this modern view audaciously claims credit for every scientific breakthrough, distancing itself from its own bad fruits -- the "revolution" is never accountable for its own genocides and famines -- all of which are the clear and inevitable consequences of this modern "revolutionary" view. Always we blame the former revolution, creating a disastrous and malevolent cycle.

The honest truth-seeking Christian gives glory and praise to God for all that is good, yet the modern view gives credit to man and perversely blames God for all that is evil.
God is love to the honest Christian, but a tyrant to the modern view.
The modern view depicts man as heroically overcoming his creator, making himself into god.
If you want to best understand the modern view, it is an inversion of orthodox Christianity at every level.


In the final analysis, we can trace this anti-Christian view all the way back
 to that serpent in the garden:
 
> And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

> For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

~ Genesis 3:4,5

Contrast this with Nietzsche's nihilistic reflections,

> Shall we not ourselves have to become gods merely to seem worthy of it?

For all his genius,
 Nietzsche's entire philosophical
 journey takes us
 back to that same serpent 
 in the garden.
Zarathustra's superman, [der Ubermensch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch), is nothing but the echo of that snake whispering to Eve,


> *"ye shall be as gods",*

If we had to name the spirit of our times -- our modern view -- it is clearly the spirit of antichrist, a deceitful and malevolent cycle of death, attacking the very spirit of truth that overcame death for our salvation.
