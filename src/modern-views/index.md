# Modern Views

What is the spirit of our times, the so-called modern view?

If you ask around you'll get different answers; some will talk of secularism, humanism, cultural "progress" and feel good political narratives. Others will talk of reactionary views to counter the former. And still others will talk of aching despair, that something is clearly wrong with the modern world. 

Yet they all speak of the same spirit:
We are at the verge of something new, a coming singularity, and life will never be the same.
From transhumanism to the sovereign individual thesis, there is a coming revolution, an awakening, an emergence, a new age. We are nearing a pivotal moment in history -- if not *the* pivotal moment in history.
We are witnessing the destruction of the old order, which is necessary for the "new" age to come.

This is the modern view.

The irony of course is that this modern "revolution" is not new. We've been at the dawning of a new age, the destruction of the old order, for quite some time now.
The new age never seems to manifest, and yet it's always promised to be happening soon if not now.

In truth, it is but the failure of every generation, the echoes of man's original sin reverberating through the ages. But let's trace this modern view back, and see if we can find where it started.




## Where did this start?

Modern intellectuals will tell you this started in the 1960s. Where the culture wars kicked off.
That's the story in the west, especially in the United States.
And there seems to be something to this, as there was a seismic shift in western culture, a rejection of rigid social norms, the start of the civil rights movement, Roe v Wade, Woodstock!
Certainly it seems as if the culture prior to the famed hippy generation was distinctly different from everything that came afterwards.

And yet, hindsight being 20-20, the fruits of that generation can be known. There was an Altamont to every Woodstock, reactions to every revolution. The few years of the late 1960s counterculture gave way to the decadence and degeneracy that marked the following decades.
And despite the abysmal failures on every front, what we can see clearly is that the 1960s were the start of a parasitism in institutions starting with academia and then into political and corporate entities. We now see the normalization of relativism, an assault on truth itself.
In fact, since the 1960s this parasitism has spread globally, and noticeably accelerated. Every generation now feels they are at the verge of a new revolution, where their struggles will be the ones that mark the coming of something new. 

"Be on the right side of history", they'll tell you, as they imagine they are making the world a better place. And yet the consequences of their actions prove the opposite even by their own naive moral standards.
This is very much the modern view, and while it has now festered into a global parasitism, we can go even further back to find the root cause.

Let's consider the second world war, with concentration camps and genocide. Without a doubt this completely reshaped the world and was the definitive end of the old world, the beginning of the new.
Hundreds of millions of dead, more death than the world had ever seen in just a handful of years.
An atomic bomb, the beginning of a nuclear arms race.
The entirety of the 1960s counterculture seems rather insignificant compared to the second world war.
Perhaps this is the better starting point of our modern view.

And yet, Hitler did not happen in a vacuum. The bloodshed of the 20th century was the consequence of the socialist experiments, from national socialism to communism. And thus we can trace the modern view back further; and it is here where the mad prophet Nietzsche is most apt.

> It may be that I am the first
> to light upon an idea which will

> all who are born after us
> belong to a higher history
> than any history hitherto.

~ Nietzsche 

You'll be hard pressed to find a better articulation of the modern view than this. And yet Dostoyevsky manages it beautifully, and prior to Nietzsche.


> Everything will be new... 
> then they will divide history
> into two parts:
>  from the gorilla to the 
>  annihilation of God,
>  and from the annihilation of God
>  to the transformation of the earth,
>  and of man physically.

~ Krillov in The Possessed
by Dostoyevsky





## Ubermensch 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch


 
 
> Shall we not ourselves have to become gods merely to seem worthy of it (the death of God)?

~ Nietzsche 

"Dead are all the gods. Now do we desire the Superman to live.”

And Kirillov in The Possessed says: “If there is no God, then I am God.”

And Dostoyevsky distinguishes between the God-man Jesus Christ and the man-god, the new being who is coming up from the earth to become god.

Zarathustra says:
 “-I bring you a goal; I preach to you the Superman. Man is something to be overcome. What have you done to overcome him? All things before you have produced something beyond themselves, and would you be the ebb of this great flood? Would you rather go back to the animal than transcend man? What is  the ape to man? A jest or a bitter shame. And just that shall man be to the Superman, a jest or a bitter shame. You have traveled the way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.... Lo, I preach to you the Superman. The Superman is the meaning of the earth.

... and Hitler believed himself to be so.


And yet these exact ideas go back even further, into the reign of terror or the French Revolution.

In fact, you'll find a clear lineage from the time of Robespierre and the atrocities of the French revolution, all the way to Hitler and the atrocities of the second world war, and then all the way to the present day to our nihilistic meaning crisis.
all marching in lockstep through 
 the Nihilist program.

We can further trace the modern view back
 before the enlightenment,
 to the Copernican revolution,
 and further 
 to the age of scholasticism,
 and even to the
 great schism
 that preceded.
For at least a thousand years every generation has been trying to destroy the old and usher in a revolution, a final revolution.

As the Joachamites imagined that the new age is here, starting with Francis of Assisi, the final age before the end of time.


In the final analysis, we can trace the modern view all the way back
 to that serpent in the garden:
 
> And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

> For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

~ Genesis 3:4,5

For all his genius,
 Nietzsche's entire philosophical
 journey takes us
 back to that same serpent 
 in the garden.
Zaratustra's superman, der Ubermensch, is nothing but the echo of that snake whispering to Eve,

> *"ye shall be as gods",*
