# Modern Views

from transhumanism to sovereign individuals

The destruction of the old order,
 which is necessary for the new age
 to come.

from Hitler to Robespierre

all marching in lockstep through 
 the Nihilist program.

> Shall we not ourselves have to become gods merely to seem worthy of it (the death of God)?

~ Nietzsche 

"Dead are all the gods. Now do we desire the Superman to live.”

And Kirillov in The Possessed says: “If there is no God, then I am God.”

And Dostoyevsky distinguishes between the God-man Jesus Christ and the man-god, the new being who is coming up from the earth to become god.

Zarathustra says:
 “-I bring you a goal; I preach to you the Superman. Man is something to be overcome. What have you done to overcome him? All things before you have produced something beyond themselves, and would you be the ebb of this great flood? Would you rather go back to the animal than transcend man? What is  the ape to man? A jest or a bitter shame. And just that shall man be to the Superman, a jest or a bitter shame. You have traveled the way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.... Lo, I preach to you the Superman. The Superman is the meaning of the earth.

... and Hitler believed himself to be so.


We can trace the modern view back
 to the enlightenment,
 to the Copernican revolution,
 to the age of scholasticism,
 and even to the
 great schism
 that preceded.
Or, we can trace it all the way back
 to that serpent in the garden:
 
> And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

> For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

~ Genesis 3:4,5

*"ye shall be as gods",*
 Nietzsche's entire philosophy can
 be summed up by that serpent 
 in Genesis.
