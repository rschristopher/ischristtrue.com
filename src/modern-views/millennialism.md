# Millennialism

Millennialism is a [modern](index.md) belief in a future utopia, usually a thousand year period (a literal *millennium*).
We've seen echoes of millennialism through western culture, from the supposed "Thousand-year Reich" in Nazi Germany to various new age and transcendental utopian movements (e.g., the *age of Aquarius*).
And it has recently become a popular view amongst protestant Christian denominations.

To be clear, these are not [ancient views](../ancient-views/index.md) although there were traces of millennialism in the ancient world (condemned by the early church).


## χίλια ἔτη (chilia etē)

Millennialism originated in the western scholastic period from interpretations of *Revelation 20:1-10* (*Apokalypsis* in Greek).
You'll find **τὰ χίλια ἔτη** *(ta chilia etē)* several times in the original Apokalypsis 20:1-10 (Revelation 20:1-10). 

*Chilia etē* literally translates as *thousand years*, hence millennialism is also known as chiliasm (pronounced kĭl′ē-ăz″əm) from the Greek "chilia" (thousand).


??? quote "Ἀποκάλυψις (Apokalypsis) 20:1-10"
    Καὶ εἶδον ἄγγελον καταβαίνοντα ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἔχοντα τὴν κλεῖν τῆς ἀβύσσου καὶ ἅλυσιν μεγάλην ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ. καὶ ἐκράτησε τὸν δράκοντα, τὸν ὄφιν τὸν ἀρχαῖον, ὅς ἐστι Διάβολος καὶ ὁ Σατανᾶς ὁ πλανῶν οἰκουμένην, καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν **χίλια ἔτη**, καὶ ἔβαλεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν ἄβυσσον, καὶ ἔκλεισε καὶ ἐσφράγισε ἐπάνω αὐτοῦ, ἵνα μὴ πλανᾷ ἔτι τὰ ἔθνη, ἄχρι τελεσθῇ **τὰ χίλια ἔτη**· μετὰ ταῦτα δεῖ αὐτὸν λυθῆναι μικρὸν χρόνον.

    Καὶ εἶδον θρόνους, καὶ ἐκάθισαν ἐπ’ αὐτούς, καὶ κρῖμα ἐδόθη αὐτοῖς, καὶ τὰς ψυχὰς τῶν πεπελεκισμένων διὰ τὴν μαρτυρίαν Ἰησοῦ καὶ διὰ τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ οἵτινες οὐ προσεκύνησαν τὸ θηρίον οὔτε τὴν εἰκόνα αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔλαβον τὸ χάραγμα ἐπὶ τὸ μέτωπον αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτῶν· καὶ ἔζησαν καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν μετὰ τοῦ Χριστοῦ **χίλια ἔτη**· καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ τῶν νεκρῶν οὐκ ἔζησαν ἕως τελεσθῇ **τὰ χίλια ἔτη**. αὕτη ἡ ἀνάστασις ἡ πρώτη. μακάριος καὶ ἅγιος ὁ ἔχων μέρος ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει τῇ πρώτῃ· ἐπὶ τούτων ὁ δεύτερος θάνατος οὐκ ἔχει ἐξουσίαν, ἀλλ’ ἔσονται ἱερεῖς Θεοῦ καὶ τοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ βασιλεύσουσι μετ’ αὐτοῦ **χίλια ἔτη**.

    Καὶ ὅταν τελεσθῇ **τὰ χίλια ἔτη**, λυθήσεται ὁ Σατανᾶς ἐκ τῆς φυλακῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται πλανῆσαι τὰ ἔθνη τὰ ἐν ταῖς τέσσαρσι γωνίαις τῆς γῆς, τὸν Γὼγ καὶ Μαγώγ, συναγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, ὧν ὁ ἀριθμὸς αὐτῶν ὡς ἡ ἄμμος τῆς θαλάσσης.

**τὰ χίλια ἔτη** *(ta chilia etē)* is translated literally as **the thousand years** in English,

???+ quote "Revelation 20:1-10"
    And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a **thousand years**, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till **the thousand years** should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.

    And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a **thousand years**. But the rest of the dead lived not again until **the thousand years** were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a **thousand years**.

    And when **the thousand years** are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

This relatively short passage has spawned countless chiliastic ideologies, social movements, and (false) predictions, including an entire genre of modern fantasy writing.
This is all despite explicit warnings in that same Book of Revelation not to add or remove anything, which is a clear warning against modern eisegesis,

!!! danger "Revelation 22:18-19"
    I testify to everyone who hears the words of prophecy in this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and the holy city, which are described in this book.



## Modern Eisegesis

While it's not surprising that non-Christians would ignore the warning from *Revelation 22:18*, it is unfortunate that many Christians dispense with this warning and add to the words of the Book of Revelation with moderm eisegesis, that is, interpreting the prophecy using modern concepts that simply did not exist in the ancient world
(from when Apokalypsis/Revelation was written).

For example, the notion of a precise 1,000 years did not exist in the original text. Zero as a number and a placeholder did not exist. 
And perhaps coincidentally, when zero was finally adopted in the west, that was about the same time that chiliasm emerged (during the early scholastic period).

Prior to that, and through all of church history, ***chilia etē*** was understood symbolically as an age or an era.
The same way we say "back in the day" to refer to a period of time and not a literal 1 day, ***ta chilia etē*** was referring to an age, specifically the *messianic age*.

The interesting part of this passage was not the thousand years, but rather the references to old testament messianic prophecies (such as from the Book of Daniel) -- which would have been common knowledge to the people in the early church.
To the early Christians, this era known as *ta chilia etē* **was** the messianic age, the penultimate age before final judgment, the time between the first and second coming of Christ.

Contrast this with modern millennialist views which do not reference the *messianic age* at all, because they need a separate name to refer to our current age. In practice they'll refer to our current age as the *"church age"*, which is separate from the future *millennium* -- effectively inventing a new age to match their eisegesis.

The earliest form of modern millennialism is probably the utopian views of 
 [the Joachimites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachimites) 
 which arose in the thirteenth century, proposing
 a new "age of the Holy Spirit" heralded by 
 [Francis of Assisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi)
 such that in the year 1260 the Christian age would end and a utopian era would arrive.
While condemned by the church this view influenced and continues to influence modern culture, 
 e.g., we see this clearly in
 the modern *new age* movement, such as the so-called
 [Age of Aquarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Aquarius).
However, the most prevalent form of millennialism arose in the 19th century, both from the
 [Bible Student movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Student_movement),
 a precursor to the [Jehovah's Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses),
 as well as protestant [dispensationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism)
 views promoting what is known as a pre-tribulation [rapture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture).

These modern chiliastic views have increased in popularity and are typically categorized based on *when* Christ would return.
Note how these all presume some knowledge of when Christ's return might occur, e.g.,




### premillennium

Christ would return *before* a literal 1,000 year period. 
There would be no rapture, both believers and non-believers would suffer during a period of tribulation.
Believers would be resurrected into immortal glorified bodies, and they would rule alongside Christ.
This would be a physical kingdom ruling over mortal non-believers.

At the end of the 1,000 years there would be a final rebellion followed by a final judgment, and a second resurrection (for the believers born during the millennium).

!!! warning "eisegesis"
    While not necessarily heretical, this view takes an eisegetic interpretation of *Revelation 20:1-10*, and assumes that the "throne" and the references to "the beast" are not from the *Old Testament* prophecies, and instead the *millennium age* will be a worldly kingdom of immortal Christians ruling over mortal non-Christians.











### pre-tribulation rapture

Christ would return *before* a literal 1,000 year period *AND* before the tribulation.
Believers would be caught up (raptured) leaving behind non-believers to suffer seven years of tribulation.

This is the
 dispensationalist view that holds that Christ would return and rule over Israel for a literal 1,000 years.
This involves *two* "second comings" of Christ and multiple resurrections; one at the rapture, another for believers after tribulation, another for Jews who accept Christ during the dispensation of Israel, and still another resurrection of non-believers at a final judgment.

!!! danger "eisegesis"
    This chiliastic view diverges from scripture; not only taking an eisegetic interpretation of *Revelation 20:1-10*, but adding to scripture in order to assert a rapture and a worldly Jewish kingdom ruled by Christ.










### postmillenium

Christ would return *after* the millennium, which would not necessarily be a literal 1,000 years. In fact, we might be in the millennium now.
This view differs from the *amillenium* position only in the assertion of a millennium which is separate from a *church age*.

From a worldly perspective there wouldn't be a cosmological difference between the *church age* and the millennium.
There would be no rapture, and only one resurrection of believers and non-believers.
During the millennium, human history would necessarily improve as earth is gradually transformed by Christ's heavenly reign.

!!! warning "eisegesis"
    While not necessarily heretical, this view takes an eisegetic interpretation of *Revelation 20:1-10*, and assumes that the "throne" and the references to "the beast" are not from the *Old Testament* prophecies, and instead the *millennium age* will somehow be different from the *church age*.










### amillenium

Christ returns when he returns, and no one but the father knows when. 

!!! quote "Matthew 24:36"
    But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.


!!! quote "Matthew 24:42-44"
    Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.



As *St. Paul* would remind us,

!!! quote "1 Thessalonians 5:1-2"
    Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 


An "amillenium" view is by definition *not* millennial. 
And perhaps we shouldn't dignify millennialism as a theological category.
E.g., we don't call Calvinists "aArminians", nor do we refer to Augustine as "aPelagian", and we never refer to Orthodox Christian doctrine as "aNestorian" or "[aArian](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd7FixvoKBw&t=2s)".

The amillenium view should perhaps just be called the "biblical view" or the "orthodox view" as it requires no eisegesis and can be understood exegetically.



















## Orthodox Exegesis

How was *Apokalypsis 20:1-10* understood by the early church fathers and throughout church history?

...
ancient chiliastic views were infrequent and were condemned. 
Most were a reaction to gnosticism in the ancient world. 
Specifically to defend a pharisaic incarnation view against gnosticism, effectively appealing to a false view to attack heretical gnostic views.
Modern chiliasm is similar in that it often embraces a false secular mechanistic interpretation of *Revelation*.

? St Iranaeus
 accused (or credited) with Chiliasm but there's no known writings affirming any such view, usually he's referring to bodily resurrection against the gnostics (which is a separate topic and he clearly wasn't arguing against modern amillenialists)

Let us first understand the *Old Testament* view, the ground from which the prophecy of Apokalypsis/Revelation emerges. 
Prior to the coming of Christ, man was in exile, in a fallen depraved state with no dominion or power over creation. 
Man was instead subordinate to the powers and principalities governing the world, which was "that old serpent".






### Dominion of Satan

!!! question "And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him"

We are told in *Revelation 20:2* that
Satan, the adversary, the Devil, was sealed in the bottomless pit. 
His dominion was no more, "that he should deceive the nations no more".

This is the same serpent, "that old serpent", from the garden in *Genesis 3*.
And note God's promise that the seed of Eve shall bruise *the head* of the serpent.

!!! quote "Genesis 3:15"
    And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

Let's be clear, Satan had earthly dominion, the nations *were* his to deceive.
The age before Christ was the dominion of Satan.
This changed first in Israel, where it was foretold that God would inherit all nations (ending the dominion of Satan).

!!! quote "Psalm 82"
    God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
    
    How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
    
    Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
    
    Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
    
    They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
    
    I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
    
    But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
    
    Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.















### Dominion of the Beasts

!!! question "worshipped the beast"

Chiliastic views often fixate on the beast in Revelation, missing that this is a direct reference to the *Old Testament* prophecies,
 specifically the fourth beast in the vision of Daniel,

!!! quote "Daniel 7:7"
    After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.

And rather than interpret *the beast* and its mark through chiliastic eisegesis, recognize that *Daniel 7* provides an exegetic interpretation,

!!! quote "Daniel 7:15-18"
    I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth. But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.

The early church understood that *the beast* in Revelation would be a king of the earth, the lawless one, the antichrist.
This beast would be the final worldly manifestion of the dominion of Satan.

!!! quote "Daniel 7:11-12"
    I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.

Look what happens to the "rest of the beasts",

!!! quote "they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time."

Let's be clear, the beasts, the worldly kings of Satan, were not bound with Satan. 
Their lives were prolonged into the *messianic age*.
This is key to understanding our current age, that is, how is Satan bound and yet we still struggle amidst evil?
Christ will rule amidst his enemies in the *messianic age* (our current age).

!!! quote "Psalm 110:2"
    The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.

And as St. Paul explains,

!!! quote "1 Corinthians 15:25"
    For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.

These surviving beasts are counted amongst the enemies of Christ.
The beasts once had dominion, but their wordly dominion was taken away. 
And now in the *messianic age* they have no power over Christians. 
Instead they tempt and deceive. 
They are no longer worldly powers that oppress humans. 
They are but powers of darkness, the absence of light and truth.












### Dominion of the Saints

!!! question "priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him"

On the cross, the serpent lost his dominion. His house was plundered,

!!! quote "Matthew 12:29"
    how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and steal his possessions, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.


Consider the power Christ had over evil spirits, and that in His life the devils knew their time of dominion would soon be over.

!!! quote "Matthew 8:28-29"
    And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way. And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?

And as St. Paul would remind us, it is only in Christ that Satan has no hold on us, otherwise the adversary's influence is still upon the world,

!!! quote "Ephesians 6:12"
    For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.

For if we turn away from Christ, then the powers and principalities of the beasts are still upon us. It is only through Christ that we overcome,

!!! quote "Daniel 7:27"
    And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.

!!! quote "Matthew 18:18"
    Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.












### Thrones

!!! question "And I saw thrones"

!!! quote "Daniel 7:9-10"
    I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.












### Son of man

The very same *Old Testament* prophecies in *Daniel 7* which help us to understand *Revelation 20*, is also the very same prophecy Christ himself fulfilled when assuming the title, *the Son of man*.

!!! quote "Daniel 7:13-14"
    I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the **Son of man** came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.

!!! quote "John 5:26-27"
    For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.

!!! success "because he is the Son of man"

And there it is, through Christ we overcome the adversary, the principalities and powers, and through Christ do we reign, as the father willed, that we would have dominion over creation.


Revelation is not a mere worldly battle of Christ vs antichrist, but rather a complete cosmological reordering, restoring mankind to the exalted purpose for which we were created. 

Mankind, who was created in the image and likeness of God, fell from grace. And after being scattered across the earth, man lost all dominion over the earth. Man was put under the submission of the serpent and his principalities and powers.

And it was Christ, the son of man, who redeemed creation. Christ bound the serpent. Christ destroyed the beasts. And now, in the messianic age, we look forward to His glorious return, and to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come.


!!! quote "Psalm 110"
    The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
    
    The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
    
    Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.
    
    The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
    
    The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
    
    He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.
    
    He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.


Note the imagery that calls back to *Genesis 3:15*, 

!!! quote "he shall wound the heads over many countries"







## Messianic Age

there are actual effects today and clear evidence that we are living in the messianic age.
who doesn't know the name Christ, or the name "Yahweh" referencing the concept of a creator, monotheistic God who spoke the world into being.
is Christ ruling, or not?
are we waiting for the second coming of Christ? or are we waiting for something else?

we have heretics, which is different, arguably better, than pagans.

even anti-Christians use a Christian ethic to judge and criticize Christianity.
Our entire notion of universal human rights and dignity...








## Heretical or Apocryphal?

Millennialism was consistently condemned by the early church. 
It was not considered a Christological error and thus not directly heretical.

*E.g., denying the Trinity, denying the divinity of Christ -- these are heresies and anathema to orthodox Christianity.*

By itself, Chiliasm is usually considered an eschatological error.
In other words, it may be fine to speculate on the end times, but making important life decisions based on a millennial belief may lead you away from Christ, away from truth.

*E.g., choosing not to have children, worrying about what happens if you are raptured and your children are not, insisting that the existing government must become "Christian" in order to prepare the way.*
