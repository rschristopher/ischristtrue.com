# Millennialism

Millennialism is a [modern belief](index.md) of a future utopian period, usually a thousand years (a literal *millennium*).
This is a common view in modern Christian denominations (especially amongst protestants).
We've seen echoes of millennialism through western culture, from the supposed "Third Reich" in Nazi Germany to various new age and transcendental utopian movements (e.g., the *age of Aquarius*).
To be clear, these are not [ancient views](../ancient-views/index.md) although there were traces of this ideology in the ancient world.


## χίλια ἔτη (chilia etē)

Literally, *thousand years*, hence millennialism is also known as *chiliasm* (pronounced kĭl′ē-ăz″əm) from the Greek "chilia" (thousand).
Chiliastic views originated in the western scholastic period from interpretations of Revelation 20:1-10 (Apokalypsis).
You'll notice **τὰ χίλια ἔτη** (the thousand years) several times in the original Greek in Apokalypsis 20:1-10 (Revelation 20:1-10),


??? quote "Ἀποκάλυψις (Apokalypsis) 20:1-10"
    Καὶ εἶδον ἄγγελον καταβαίνοντα ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἔχοντα τὴν κλεῖν τῆς ἀβύσσου καὶ ἅλυσιν μεγάλην ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ. καὶ ἐκράτησε τὸν δράκοντα, τὸν ὄφιν τὸν ἀρχαῖον, ὅς ἐστι Διάβολος καὶ ὁ Σατανᾶς ὁ πλανῶν οἰκουμένην, καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν **χίλια ἔτη**, καὶ ἔβαλεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν ἄβυσσον, καὶ ἔκλεισε καὶ ἐσφράγισε ἐπάνω αὐτοῦ, ἵνα μὴ πλανᾷ ἔτι τὰ ἔθνη, ἄχρι τελεσθῇ **τὰ χίλια ἔτη**· μετὰ ταῦτα δεῖ αὐτὸν λυθῆναι μικρὸν χρόνον.

    Καὶ εἶδον θρόνους, καὶ ἐκάθισαν ἐπ’ αὐτούς, καὶ κρῖμα ἐδόθη αὐτοῖς, καὶ τὰς ψυχὰς τῶν πεπελεκισμένων διὰ τὴν μαρτυρίαν Ἰησοῦ καὶ διὰ τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ οἵτινες οὐ προσεκύνησαν τὸ θηρίον οὔτε τὴν εἰκόνα αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔλαβον τὸ χάραγμα ἐπὶ τὸ μέτωπον αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτῶν· καὶ ἔζησαν καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν μετὰ τοῦ Χριστοῦ **χίλια ἔτη**· καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ τῶν νεκρῶν οὐκ ἔζησαν ἕως τελεσθῇ **τὰ χίλια ἔτη**. αὕτη ἡ ἀνάστασις ἡ πρώτη. μακάριος καὶ ἅγιος ὁ ἔχων μέρος ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει τῇ πρώτῃ· ἐπὶ τούτων ὁ δεύτερος θάνατος οὐκ ἔχει ἐξουσίαν, ἀλλ’ ἔσονται ἱερεῖς Θεοῦ καὶ τοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ βασιλεύσουσι μετ’ αὐτοῦ **χίλια ἔτη**.

    Καὶ ὅταν τελεσθῇ **τὰ χίλια ἔτη**, λυθήσεται ὁ Σατανᾶς ἐκ τῆς φυλακῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται πλανῆσαι τὰ ἔθνη τὰ ἐν ταῖς τέσσαρσι γωνίαις τῆς γῆς, τὸν Γὼγ καὶ Μαγώγ, συναγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, ὧν ὁ ἀριθμὸς αὐτῶν ὡς ἡ ἄμμος τῆς θαλάσσης.

**τὰ χίλια ἔτη** is typically translated as **the thousand years** in English,

???+ quote "Revelation 20:1-10"
    And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a **thousand years**, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till **the thousand years** should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.

    And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a **thousand years**. But the rest of the dead lived not again until **the thousand years** were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a **thousand years**.

    And when **the thousand years** are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

This relatively short passage has spawned countless chiliastic ideologies, social movements, and (false) predictions, including an entire genre of modern fantasy writing.
This is all despite explicit warnings in that same Book of Revelation not to add or remove anything, which is a clear warning against modern eisegesis,

!!! danger "Revelation 22:18-19"
    I testify to everyone who hears the words of prophecy in this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and the holy city, which are described in this book.



## Modern Eisegesis

While it's not surprising that non-Christians would ignore the warning from Revelation 22:18, it is unfortunate that many Christians dispense with this warning and add to the words of the Book of Revelation with moderm eisegesis, that is, interpreting the passage using modern concepts that simply did not exist in the ancient world
(from when this book was written).

For example, the notion of a precise 1,000 years did not exist in the original passage. Zero as a number and a placeholder did not exist. 
And perhaps coincidentally, when zero was finally adopted in the west, that was about the same time that chiliasm emerged (during the early scholastic period).

Prior to that, and through all of church history, ***chilia etē*** was understood symbolically as an age or an era.
The same way we say "back in the day" to refer to a period of time and not a literal 1 day, ***ta chilia etē*** was referring to an age, specifically the *messianic age*.

The interesting part of this passage was not the thousand years, but rather the referenced old testament messianic prophecies (such as from the Book of Daniel) -- which would have been common knowledge to the people in the early church.
To the early Christians, this era known as *ta chilia etē* **was** the messianic age, the penultimate age before final judgment, the time between the first and second coming of Christ.

Contrast this with modern millennialist views which do not reference the *messianic age* at all, because they need a separate age from the millennium. In practice they'll refer to our current age as the *"church age"* which is separate from the *messianic age* -- effectively inventing a new age to match their eisegesis.

The earliest form of this modern millennialism points back to the utopian views of 
 [the Joachimites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachimites) 
 which arose in the thirteenth century, proposing
 a new "age of the Holy Spirit" heralded by 
 [Francis of Assisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi)
 such that in the year 1260 the Christian age would end and a utopian era would arrive.
While condemned by the church this view influenced and continues to influence modern culture, 
 e.g., we see this clearly in
 the modern new age movement and the so-called
 [Age of Aquarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Aquarius).
However, the most prevalent form of millennialism arose in the 19th century, both from the
 [Bible Student movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Student_movement),
 a precursor to the [Jehovah's Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses),
 as well as protestant [dispensationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism)
 views promoting a "pre-tribulation [rapture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture)".


These chiliastic views have increased in popularity and are typically categorized based on *when* Christ will return:




### premillennialism

This is considered the "historic premillennial" view, that Christ will return before the millennium, after the 7 years of tribulation.
Believers and non-believers will suffer during the years of tribulation and afterwards believers will be resurrected in glorified bodies.
Christ will reign on earth for a thousand years alongside the immortal resurrected believers, who will share the earth with non-believers.
This will continue till the millennium is over, and then after a final rebellion amongst non-believers, believers will enter into a new earth.





### pre-tribulation rapture

This is the
 dispensationalist
 view that has become common in modern times.
 It is similar to the classic premillennial view except that believers will not experience tribulation but will be caught up in the rapture.
This view also holds that the millennium will be for Israel, to rule over the earth with Christ for a thousand years.






### postmillenialism

In this view, the millennium is separate from the "church age" and Christ will only return after the millennium. We may or may not be living in the millennium, and the difference between "church age" and millennium is that the millennium will see the gradual dominance of Christianity across the earth.






### amillenialism

like "partial preterism", we perhaps shouldn't dignify millennialism as a category.

e.g., we don't say apelagianism, anestorianism, or aarianism, and we don't call Calvinism "aarminianism".

amillenialism should perhaps just be called the "biblical view" or the "orthodox view" as it requires no modern eisegesis and can be understood exegetically.





## Orthodox Exegesis

How was this obscure passage, Apokalypsis 20, understood by the early church fathers and throughout church history?

...
ancient chiliastic views were infrequent and we're condemned. Most were a reaction to gnosticism in the ancient world. Specifically to defend the pharisaic incarnation view against gnosticism, effectively appealing to a false view to attack heretical gnostic views.
Modern chiliasm is similar in that it often embraces a false secular mechanistic interpretation of Revelation 20.

etc


? St Iranaeus
 accused (or credited) with Chiliasm but there's no known writings affirming any such view, usually he's referring to bodily resurrection against the gnostics (which is a separate topic and he clearly wasn't arguing against modern amillenialists)

## Messianic Age

there are actual effects today and clear evidence that we are living in the messianic age.
who doesn't know the name Christ, or the name "Yahweh" referencing the concept of a creator, monotheistic God who spoke the world into being.
is Christ ruling, or not?
are we waiting for the second coming of Christ? or are we waiting for something else?

we have heretics, which is different, arguably better, than pagans.

even anti-Christians use a Christian ethic to judge and criticize Christianity.
Our entire notion of universal human rights and dignity...





## Heretical or not?

chiliasm was condemned by the early church. It was not considered a christological error and thus not heretical, although many heretical views are related to chiliasm.
By itself, t is an eschatological error, and not necessarily heretical.
