# Millennialism

aka, Chiliasm

ancient chiliastic views were infrequent and we're condemned, most were a reaction to gnosticism in the ancient world. Specifically to defend the pharisaic incarnation view..
The modern version of chiliasm is simily that it defends the secular mechanistic view.. that is, it embraces a literal mechanistic interpretation of the millennium and the messianic age.

There are many forms of millennialism, and all require a separation of the messianic age from the millennium, and hence chiliastic literature refers to the "church age" as our current age, rather than "messianic age", which is the "millennium" usually taken literally from a modern worldview.



historic uses

year 1000
Joachim, joachamites
3rd Reich
etc


? St Iranaeus
 accused (or credited) with Chiliasm but there's no known writings affirming any such view, usually he's referring to bodily resurrection against the gnostics (which is a separate topic and he clearly wasn't arguing against modern amillenialists)

Rev. 20:1-8

mil, age, aions, eons, etc



the messianic age
penultimate age before final judgment

Daniel 7
Daniel 7:12 

Psalm 110

Psalm 82

there are actual effects today and clear evidence that we are living in the messianic age.
who doesn't know the name Christ, or Yaweh
is Christ ruling, or not?
we have heretics, which is different, arguably better, than pagans.

even anti-Christians use a Christian ethic to judge and criticize Christianity.
Our entire notion of universal human rights and dignity...


chiliasm was condemned by the early church. It was considered a christological error and thus not heretical, although many heretical views are related to chiliasm.
it is at worst an eschatological error.



 # amillenialism

 like "partial preterism", we perhaps shouldn't dignify Millennialism as doctrine, but it's arguably not heretical...

 e.g., we don't say apelagianism, anestorianism, or aarianism, or we don't call Calvinism aarminianism.

 amillenialism should perhaps just be called "biblical view" as it requires no eisegesis and can ve understood exegetically.
