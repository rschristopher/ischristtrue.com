# Millennialism

aka, Chiliasm

!!! quote "Revelation 20:1-10"
    Καὶ εἶδον ἄγγελον καταβαίνοντα ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἔχοντα τὴν κλεῖν τῆς ἀβύσσου καὶ ἅλυσιν μεγάλην ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ. καὶ ἐκράτησε τὸν δράκοντα, τὸν ὄφιν τὸν ἀρχαῖον, ὅς ἐστι Διάβολος καὶ ὁ Σατανᾶς ὁ πλανῶν οἰκουμένην, καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν **χίλια ἔτη**, καὶ ἔβαλεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν ἄβυσσον, καὶ ἔκλεισε καὶ ἐσφράγισε ἐπάνω αὐτοῦ, ἵνα μὴ πλανᾷ ἔτι τὰ ἔθνη, ἄχρι τελεσθῇ **τὰ χίλια ἔτη**· μετὰ ταῦτα δεῖ αὐτὸν λυθῆναι μικρὸν χρόνον.
    Καὶ εἶδον θρόνους, καὶ ἐκάθισαν ἐπ’ αὐτούς, καὶ κρῖμα ἐδόθη αὐτοῖς, καὶ τὰς ψυχὰς τῶν πεπελεκισμένων διὰ τὴν μαρτυρίαν Ἰησοῦ καὶ διὰ τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ οἵτινες οὐ προσεκύνησαν τὸ θηρίον οὔτε τὴν εἰκόνα αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔλαβον τὸ χάραγμα ἐπὶ τὸ μέτωπον αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτῶν· καὶ ἔζησαν καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν μετὰ τοῦ Χριστοῦ **χίλια ἔτη**· καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ τῶν νεκρῶν οὐκ ἔζησαν ἕως τελεσθῇ **τὰ χίλια ἔτη**. αὕτη ἡ ἀνάστασις ἡ πρώτη. μακάριος καὶ ἅγιος ὁ ἔχων μέρος ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει τῇ πρώτῃ· ἐπὶ τούτων ὁ δεύτερος θάνατος οὐκ ἔχει ἐξουσίαν, ἀλλ’ ἔσονται ἱερεῖς Θεοῦ καὶ τοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ βασιλεύσουσι μετ’ αὐτοῦ **χίλια ἔτη**.
    Καὶ ὅταν τελεσθῇ **τὰ χίλια ἔτη**, λυθήσεται ὁ Σατανᾶς ἐκ τῆς φυλακῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται πλανῆσαι τὰ ἔθνη τὰ ἐν ταῖς τέσσαρσι γωνίαις τῆς γῆς, τὸν Γὼγ καὶ Μαγώγ, συναγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, ὧν ὁ ἀριθμὸς αὐτῶν ὡς ἡ ἄμμος τῆς θαλάσσης.

    And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a **thousand years**, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till **the thousand years** should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.
    And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a **thousand years**. But the rest of the dead lived not again until **the thousand years** were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a **thousand years**.
    And when **the thousand years** are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

ancient chiliastic views were infrequent and we're condemned, most were a reaction to gnosticism in the ancient world. Specifically to defend the pharisaic incarnation view..
The modern version of chiliasm is simily that it defends the secular mechanistic view.. that is, it embraces a literal mechanistic interpretation of the millennium and the messianic age.

There are many forms of millennialism, and all require a separation of the messianic age from the millennium, and hence chiliastic literature refers to the "church age" as our current age, rather than "messianic age", which is the "millennium" usually taken literally from a modern worldview.



historic uses

year 1000
Joachim, joachamites
3rd Reich
etc


? St Iranaeus
 accused (or credited) with Chiliasm but there's no known writings affirming any such view, usually he's referring to bodily resurrection against the gnostics (which is a separate topic and he clearly wasn't arguing against modern amillenialists)

Rev. 20:1-8

mil, age, aions, eons, etc



the messianic age
penultimate age before final judgment

Daniel 7
Daniel 7:12 

Psalm 110

Psalm 82

there are actual effects today and clear evidence that we are living in the messianic age.
who doesn't know the name Christ, or Yaweh
is Christ ruling, or not?
we have heretics, which is different, arguably better, than pagans.

even anti-Christians use a Christian ethic to judge and criticize Christianity.
Our entire notion of universal human rights and dignity...


chiliasm was condemned by the early church. It was considered a christological error and thus not heretical, although many heretical views are related to chiliasm.
it is at worst an eschatological error.



 # amillenialism

 like "partial preterism", we perhaps shouldn't dignify Millennialism as doctrine, but it's arguably not heretical...

 e.g., we don't say apelagianism, anestorianism, or aarianism, or we don't call Calvinism aarminianism.

 amillenialism should perhaps just be called "biblical view" as it requires no eisegesis and can ve understood exegetically.
