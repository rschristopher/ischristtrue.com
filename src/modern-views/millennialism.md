# Millennialism

Millennialism is a [modern belief](index.md) of a future utopian period, usually a thousand years (a literal *millennium*).
This is a common view in modern Christian denominations (especially amongst protestants).
We've seen echoes of millennialism through western culture, from the supposed "Third Reich" in Nazi Germany to various new age and transcendental utopian movements (e.g., the *age of Aquarius*).

To be clear, these are not [ancient views](../ancient-views/index.md) although there were traces of millennialism in the ancient world.


## χίλια ἔτη (chilia etē)

Millennialism originated in the western scholastic period from interpretations of Revelation 20:1-10 (Apokalypsis in Greek).
You'll notice **τὰ χίλια ἔτη** *(ta chilia etē)* several times in the original Greek in Apokalypsis 20:1-10 (Revelation 20:1-10). 

*Chilia etē* literally translates as *thousand years*, hence millennialism is also known as chiliasm (pronounced kĭl′ē-ăz″əm) from the Greek "chilia" (thousand).


??? quote "Ἀποκάλυψις (Apokalypsis) 20:1-10"
    Καὶ εἶδον ἄγγελον καταβαίνοντα ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἔχοντα τὴν κλεῖν τῆς ἀβύσσου καὶ ἅλυσιν μεγάλην ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ. καὶ ἐκράτησε τὸν δράκοντα, τὸν ὄφιν τὸν ἀρχαῖον, ὅς ἐστι Διάβολος καὶ ὁ Σατανᾶς ὁ πλανῶν οἰκουμένην, καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν **χίλια ἔτη**, καὶ ἔβαλεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν ἄβυσσον, καὶ ἔκλεισε καὶ ἐσφράγισε ἐπάνω αὐτοῦ, ἵνα μὴ πλανᾷ ἔτι τὰ ἔθνη, ἄχρι τελεσθῇ **τὰ χίλια ἔτη**· μετὰ ταῦτα δεῖ αὐτὸν λυθῆναι μικρὸν χρόνον.

    Καὶ εἶδον θρόνους, καὶ ἐκάθισαν ἐπ’ αὐτούς, καὶ κρῖμα ἐδόθη αὐτοῖς, καὶ τὰς ψυχὰς τῶν πεπελεκισμένων διὰ τὴν μαρτυρίαν Ἰησοῦ καὶ διὰ τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ οἵτινες οὐ προσεκύνησαν τὸ θηρίον οὔτε τὴν εἰκόνα αὐτοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἔλαβον τὸ χάραγμα ἐπὶ τὸ μέτωπον αὐτῶν καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτῶν· καὶ ἔζησαν καὶ ἐβασίλευσαν μετὰ τοῦ Χριστοῦ **χίλια ἔτη**· καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ τῶν νεκρῶν οὐκ ἔζησαν ἕως τελεσθῇ **τὰ χίλια ἔτη**. αὕτη ἡ ἀνάστασις ἡ πρώτη. μακάριος καὶ ἅγιος ὁ ἔχων μέρος ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει τῇ πρώτῃ· ἐπὶ τούτων ὁ δεύτερος θάνατος οὐκ ἔχει ἐξουσίαν, ἀλλ’ ἔσονται ἱερεῖς Θεοῦ καὶ τοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ βασιλεύσουσι μετ’ αὐτοῦ **χίλια ἔτη**.

    Καὶ ὅταν τελεσθῇ **τὰ χίλια ἔτη**, λυθήσεται ὁ Σατανᾶς ἐκ τῆς φυλακῆς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται πλανῆσαι τὰ ἔθνη τὰ ἐν ταῖς τέσσαρσι γωνίαις τῆς γῆς, τὸν Γὼγ καὶ Μαγώγ, συναγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς εἰς τὸν πόλεμον, ὧν ὁ ἀριθμὸς αὐτῶν ὡς ἡ ἄμμος τῆς θαλάσσης.

**τὰ χίλια ἔτη** *(ta chilia etē)* is translated literally as **the thousand years** in English,

???+ quote "Revelation 20:1-10"
    And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a **thousand years**, And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till **the thousand years** should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.

    And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a **thousand years**. But the rest of the dead lived not again until **the thousand years** were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a **thousand years**.

    And when **the thousand years** are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

This relatively short passage has spawned countless chiliastic ideologies, social movements, and (false) predictions, including an entire genre of modern fantasy writing.
This is all despite explicit warnings in that same Book of Revelation not to add or remove anything, which is a clear warning against modern eisegesis,

!!! danger "Revelation 22:18-19"
    I testify to everyone who hears the words of prophecy in this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and the holy city, which are described in this book.



## Modern Eisegesis

While it's not surprising that non-Christians would ignore the warning from *Revelation 22:18*, it is unfortunate that many Christians dispense with this warning and add to the words of the Book of Revelation with moderm eisegesis, that is, interpreting the passage using modern concepts that simply did not exist in the ancient world
(from when Apokalypsis/Revelation was written).

For example, the notion of a precise 1,000 years did not exist in the original text. Zero as a number and a placeholder did not exist. 
And perhaps coincidentally, when zero was finally adopted in the west, that was about the same time that chiliasm emerged (during the early scholastic period).

Prior to that, and through all of church history, ***chilia etē*** was understood symbolically as an age or an era.
The same way we say "back in the day" to refer to a period of time and not a literal 1 day, ***ta chilia etē*** was referring to an age, specifically the *messianic age*.

The interesting part of this passage was not the thousand years, but rather the references to old testament messianic prophecies (such as from the Book of Daniel) -- which would have been common knowledge to the people in the early church.
To the early Christians, this era known as *ta chilia etē* **was** the messianic age, the penultimate age before final judgment, the time between the first and second coming of Christ.

Contrast this with modern millennialist views which do not reference the *messianic age* at all, because they need a separate age from the millennium. In practice they'll refer to our current age as the *"church age"* which is separate from a future *messianic age* -- effectively inventing a new age to match their eisegesis.

The earliest form of this modern millennialism points back to the utopian views of 
 [the Joachimites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachimites) 
 which arose in the thirteenth century, proposing
 a new "age of the Holy Spirit" heralded by 
 [Francis of Assisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi)
 such that in the year 1260 the Christian age would end and a utopian era would arrive.
While condemned by the church this view influenced and continues to influence modern culture, 
 e.g., we see this clearly in
 the modern new age movement, such as the so-called
 [Age of Aquarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Aquarius).
However, the most prevalent form of millennialism arose in the 19th century, both from the
 [Bible Student movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Student_movement),
 a precursor to the [Jehovah's Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses),
 as well as protestant [dispensationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism)
 views promoting what is known as a pre-tribulation [rapture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture).

These modern chiliastic views have increased in popularity and are typically categorized based on *when* Christ will return, e.g.,




### premillennium

Christ would return *before* a literal 1,000 year period. 
There would be no rapture, both believers and non-believers would suffer during a period of tribulation.
Believers would be resurrected into immortal glorified bodies, and they would rule alongside Christ.
This would be a physical kingdom alongside mortal non-believers.

At the end of the 1,000 years there would be a final rebellion followed by a final judgment, and a second resurrection (for the believers born during the millennium).

!!! warning "eisegesis"
    While not necessarily heretical, this view takes an eisegetic interpretation of *Revelation 20:1-10*, and assumes that the "throne" and the references to "the beast" are not from the *Old Testament* prophecies, and instead the *millennium age* will be a worldly kingdom of immortal Christians ruling over mortal non-Christians.











### pre-tribulation rapture

Christ would return *before* a literal 1,000 year period *AND* before the tribulation.
Believers would be caught up (raptured) leaving behind non-believers to suffer seven years of tribulation.

This is the
 dispensationalist view that holds that Christ would return and rule over Israel for a literal 1,000 years.
This involves *two* "second comings" of Christ and multiple resurrections; one at the rapture, another for believers after tribulation, another for Jews who accept Christ during the dispensation of Israel, and still another resurrection of non-believers at a final judgment.

!!! danger "eisegesis"
    This chiliastic view is the closest to heretical; not only taking an eisegetic interpretation of *Revelation 20:1-10*, but adding to scripture in order to assert a rapture and a worldly Jewish kingdom ruled by Christ.










### postmillenium

Christ would return *after* the millennium, which would not necessarily be a literal 1,000 years. In fact, we might be in the millennium now.
This view differs from the *amillenium* position only in the assertion of a millennium which is separate from a *church age*.

From a worldly perspective there wouldn't be a cosmological difference between the *church age* and the millennium.
There would be no rapture, and only one resurrection of believers and non-believers.
During the millennium, human history would necessarily improve as earth is gradually transformed by Christ's heavenly reign.

!!! warning "eisegesis"
    While not necessarily heretical, this view takes an eisegetic interpretation of *Revelation 20:1-10*, and assumes that the "throne" and the references to "the beast" are not from the *Old Testament* prophecies, and instead the *millennium age* will somehow be different from the *church age*.










### amillenium

Christ returns when he returns, and no one but the father knows when. As *St. Paul* would remind us,

!!! quote "1 Thessalonians 5:1-2"
    Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 

This view is by definition *not* millennial. 
Perhaps we shouldn't dignify millennialism as a theological category.
E.g., we don't call Calvinists "aArminians", nor do we refer to Augustine as "aPelagian", and we never refer to Orthodox Christian doctrine as "aNestorian" or "aArian".

Am amillenium view should perhaps just be called the "biblical view" or the "orthodox view" as it requires no eisegesis and can be understood exegetically.






## Orthodox Exegesis

How was *Apokalypsis 20:1-10* understood by the early church fathers and throughout church history?

...
ancient chiliastic views were infrequent and were condemned. Most were a reaction to gnosticism in the ancient world. Specifically to defend a pharisaic incarnation view against gnosticism, effectively appealing to a false view to attack heretical gnostic views.
Modern chiliasm is similar in that it often embraces a false secular mechanistic interpretation of *Revelation 20:1-10*.


Matthew 12:29 
bind the strong man


? St Iranaeus
 accused (or credited) with Chiliasm but there's no known writings affirming any such view, usually he's referring to bodily resurrection against the gnostics (which is a separate topic and he clearly wasn't arguing against modern amillenialists)


Daniel 7
Daniel 7:12 

Psalm 110

Psalm 82





## Messianic Age

there are actual effects today and clear evidence that we are living in the messianic age.
who doesn't know the name Christ, or the name "Yahweh" referencing the concept of a creator, monotheistic God who spoke the world into being.
is Christ ruling, or not?
are we waiting for the second coming of Christ? or are we waiting for something else?

we have heretics, which is different, arguably better, than pagans.

even anti-Christians use a Christian ethic to judge and criticize Christianity.
Our entire notion of universal human rights and dignity...





## Heretical or not?

Chiliasm was consistently condemned by the early church. 
It was not considered a Christological error and thus not directly heretical.
E.g., denying the Trinity, denying the divinity of Christ -- these are heresies and anathema to orthodox Christianity.

By itself, Chiliasm is usually considered an eschatological error.
In other words, it may be fine to speculate on the end times, but making important life decisions based on a millennial belief may lead you away from Christ, away from truth.
E.g., chosing not to have children, worrying about what happens if you are raptured and your children are not, insisting that the existing government must become "Christian" in order to prepare the way.
