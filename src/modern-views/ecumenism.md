vain unity over truth


Even where truth is the goal, we see obvious demonic deception in most theological debates, even such benign areas such as [justification](justification.md). We see misrepresentations of Catholicism, of Orthodoxy, and of protestantism.

We see bad faith arguments, straw men, and a notable lack of love for those professing to be Christians.

latin slogans and senseless controversies

I see little pursuit of truth and a lot of pride -- God help us and may Christ lead us to truth.

That is the inevitable goal, whether we get there in glorified humility, or are cast into a lake of fire having never known Him (God help us).

So many theological arguments seem to be arguing with God, as if to tell the creator of the universe what he must do, what His his justice and love really mean.






## Denominations

We cannot ignore Orthodoxy nor Roman Catholicism (papal protestantism) nor modern protestantism, they are the Christian history, the foundation of Christianity as it exists today.
God has allowed the schisms and reformations, allowing us to fall, again and again, if only to stand up and accept His divine rule.

We are all deserving of that lake of fire, and only by His infinite mercy and love for mankind are we being spared, all of this so that we may learn humility and to love one another as He loves us.


## Mere Christianity and Truth

...





## Heresies

We must call put heresies, and never seek vain unity over truth.

We must submit to Christ and serve one another, Christians and non-Christians alike.
And we must speak the truth -+ the painful truth of our sin -- and call out our own heresies that we may be humbled enough to love those that oppose us.
