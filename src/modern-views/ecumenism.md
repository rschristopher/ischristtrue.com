# Ecumenism

!!! quote "Romans 16:17-20"
    Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil. And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.

## Vain Unity Over Truth

In our modern quest for harmony among Christian traditions, ecumenism often emerges as a noble pursuit -- a bridge across the chasms of division. Yet, beneath its veneer of goodwill lies a perilous temptation: the elevation of unity above truth. As seekers of what is real, we must ask: Can there be true unity without submission to the unalterable Truth that is Christ?

Even in debates where truth is ostensibly the aim, we witness distortions that border on demonic deception. Consider the discussions surrounding [justification](justification.md), a doctrine central to the faith. Here, misrepresentations abound: Catholicism is caricatured as works-righteousness devoid of grace; Orthodoxy as ritualistic mysticism without substance; Protestantism as individualistic chaos untethered from tradition. These are not mere disagreements but straw men erected in bad faith, laced with pride rather than the love Christ commands.

Latin slogans echo through these controversies -- *sola fide*, *sola scriptura* -- fueling senseless divisions that prioritize human constructs over divine revelation. Where is the pursuit of truth amid this clamor? Instead, we find arrogance, as if creation dare instruct the Creator on the nature of His justice and love. God help us; may Christ lead us to truth. For that is the inevitable goal -- whether we arrive in glorified humility or are cast into the lake of fire, having never truly known Him.

## Denominations

We cannot ignore the vast tapestry of Christian history: Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism (often derided as "papal Protestantism"), and modern Protestantism form the foundation of Christianity as it stands today. God has permitted schisms and reformations, allowing us to stumble and fall repeatedly, if only to rise and accept His divine rule.

We are all deserving of that lake of fire, spared only by His infinite mercy and love for mankind. Through these divisions, He teaches us humility and calls us to love one another as He loves us -- Christians and non-Christians alike, and to pray ceaselessly for ourselves, our neighbors, and even our enemies.

## Mere Christianity and Truth

The concept of "mere Christianity," popularized by C.S. Lewis, seeks a common ground amid doctrinal differences. Yet, even this well-intentioned framework risks diluting the fullness of the Truth. True ecumenism, if it exists at all, must be rooted not in compromise but in a shared submission to Christ. It demands an ever-deepening relationship with Him, marked by repentance and a confession of the singular unity of His Church.

Ecumenical dialogue should not blur lines but invite the heterodox -- those outside the fullness of His Church, including ourselves in our struggles -- to work out our salvation with fear and trembling. There is one Christ, one Church; vain unity that sacrifices truth is anathema.

## Heresies

We must boldly call out heresies, never seeking superficial harmony at the expense of eternal truth. Submission to Christ means serving one another with humility (to Christ), speaking the painful reality of our sin, and confronting our own heresies first. Only in such humility can we love those who oppose us.
