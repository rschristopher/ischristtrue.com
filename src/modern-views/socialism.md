# Socialism

As Fr. Seraphim Rose said,
> These ideas were atheistic, 
> materialistic, extremely naive: 
> science is the answer to everything. 
> The philosophy itself is 
> extremely stupid and there is 
> nothing much worth believing, 
> but his [Marxâ€™s] power comes
> from his passion to overthrow
> the existing order.
