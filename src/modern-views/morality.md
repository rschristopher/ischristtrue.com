# Morality

What is right, what is wrong.

The nature of good and evil, of progress, or even just the word *better*.

What makes something good, morally right, is often simplified to,

1. it is beneficial for you, and
2. does no harm to anyone around you.

Unfortunately, this view misses a rather critical problem ...

We would be wise to amend this to,

1. it is beneficial for you, now and in the future, and
2. it is simultaneously beneficial for those around you, now and in the future.

And while this is clearly better advice than the prior attempt, there still remains a fundamental problem...

We should include,

3. it is what you are called to do by your creator, that is, it is your purpose in life

We're getting much better, and yet still there's a problem ...

4. it glorifies God, which is your purpose, as you are created in the image abd likeness of God




## Conclusion

Something is good *if, and only if,*

1. it is beneficial for you, now and in the future, including to your children's children, and
2. it is simultaneously beneficial for those around you, all of society, now and in the future, and
3. it is what you are called to do by your creator, that is, it is your purpose in life, and
4. it glorifies God, which is your highest purpose, as you are created in the image and likeness of God.
