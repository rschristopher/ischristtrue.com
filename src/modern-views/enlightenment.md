# Age of Enlightenment

The Age of Enlightenment, hailed as the triumphant "Age of Reason," vowed to liberate humanity through unaided intellect, promising unending progress, universal happiness, and moral clarity derived solely from logic and science. Spanning the 17th and 18th centuries across Europe, it exalted reason, empiricism, and individual rights as the antidotes to ignorance, tyranny, and superstition. Visionaries like Voltaire, Rousseau, Locke, and Newton proclaimed reason the ultimate arbiter, poised to decode the cosmos and perfect society. But judged by its own lofty benchmarks -- rational morality, societal harmony, and empirical truth -- the Enlightenment stands exposed as a catastrophic flop, a house of cards that collapsed under its own weight, spawning the very chaos, relativism, and barbarism it swore to eradicate.

Objective [truth](../truth/) isn't forged in the crucible of human logic but revealed personally by the Spirit of Truth, God Himself. The Enlightenment's idolatry of reason flips this divine order, crowning humans as self-luminary gods, in direct defiance of Christ's declaration: "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life" (John 8:12). Genuine enlightenment flows not from self but from union with Christ, the eternal Logos.

## History and Critique

Unfolding from late-17th-century England to the 1789 French Revolution, the Enlightenment bubbled with optimism, propelled by breakthroughs in science and philosophy. Yet, as Archpriest Gregory Hallam dissects in [Orthodoxy and the Enlightenment](https://www.pravmir.com/orthodoxy-and-the-enlightenment/), it sprouted humanism from Renaissance and Reformation roots, yielding deism -- a tepid faith in an absentee "clockmaker" God who winds up the universe and bows out, abandoning miracles, revelation, and sacraments as pre-rational nonsense.

This "rational" ethic infected Europe, igniting revolutions and empires laced with anti-Christian venom. France's Revolution devolved into guillotine terror, branding the Church an enemy. Britain's deism smothered vibrant faith, barely offset by heart-centered Methodism. Hallam exposes the fragmentation: mind versus heart, reason clashing with faith -- a false binary Orthodoxy heals through integrated prayer.

Isolated by Ottoman chains and Russian upheavals, Orthodoxy engaged the Enlightenment posthumously, unmasking its secular sleight-of-hand that swapped sacred mystery for diluted rationalism, birthing atheism. Hume's evidence obsession torpedoed reason's throne, ushering scientism. But Orthodoxy rejects the split: knowledge blooms in prayerful synergy of mind and heart.

## Rationalism's Limits

The Enlightenment's boast -- unaided reason seizing ultimate truth -- implodes on inspection, flunking its own rational rigor. Reason can't corral creation, much less its Creator. Math, reason's crown jewel, hinges on irrationals like π (endless, unresolved) or √2 (square diagonal). Fractals boast "impossible" feats: bounded space in boundless bounds, mirroring nature's clouds, trees, cells via chaos theory, eluding rational grasp.

If math and matter defy total reason, how dare it cage God, architect of logic, space, time? Enlightenment rationalism posits a clockwork cosmos where God (if any) bows to human logic, akin to Calvin's rigid predestination -- yet Scripture unveils a God delighting in one repentant's turnaround (Luke 15:7), shattering mechanistic molds.

[Logic and reason](../truth/) are mere consciousness tools, not autonomous; they spring from Christ's revealed Truth. Sans this anchor, knowledge spirals into delusion or endless regress -- "turtles all the way down." Postmodern jabs nail rationalism's hubris but botch by ditching truth for relativist power plays.

Orthodoxy counters with hesychasm: mind plunging into heart via prayer, fusing reason with revelation. Hallam paints it: mind heeds the Spirit's whisper, meeting Christ pre-comprehension, alchemizing knowledge, harmonizing faith-reason, heart-mind -- sans Enlightenment strife.

## Enlightenment Nihilism

By its own metrics of rational progress and moral elevation, the Enlightenment bombed spectacularly, birthing nihilism -- wholesale dismissal of objective ethics, beauty, meaning -- and a modern hellscape of despair. Despite vows of harmony, it sired blood-soaked revolutions, world wars, genocides, totalitarian nightmares (Nazism, Communism), ecological ruin, and psychic plagues like depression epidemics. Universities peddle "your truth" relativism, warping beauty to fad and morality to dominance, fueling a meaning void that mocks suffering and purpose.

Internal rot doomed it: jettisoning Aristotelian telos (human purpose), reason became means-minus-ends, per Hume's is/ought chasm; Kant's duty ethic flopped in yielding concrete morals; Hume's desire-based utility couldn't justify justice; Kierkegaard's ethical leap lacked rationale. This birthed emotivism: morals as manipulative feels, sans standards. Nietzsche lambasted its cowardice -- toppling dogmas but erecting new "metanarratives" that stifled freedom. Frankfurt School decried tech triumphs sans moral growth, enabling industrialized horrors like Auschwitz.

Orthodoxy triumphs: Christ, Truth embodied (John 14:6), links God to man, unveiling knowable creation. Spurn Him? Self-damnation to void. Beauty beckons return to grace.

Enlightenment's "light"? A fraudulent flicker, dooming modernity. Orthodoxy's? Eternal blaze: heart-mind in Christ, redeeming all. Hallam nails it: Unleash Orthodoxy on the West, watch this sham evaporate.
