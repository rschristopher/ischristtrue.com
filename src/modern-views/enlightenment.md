# Age of Enlightenment

To be enlightened means to be "*a light onto oneself*".
It is shine the light of reason out into the unknown.

It is sleight of hand -- reason does not shine from us, but from God.

Worshipping Reason

Rationalism as a supreme authority.

For starters,
 rationality cannot measure or contain 
 created reality,
 at any level
 (let alone the transcendent source of all that is,
  including rationality itself). 
Even a circle requires an irrational constant. 
A diagonal in a square is irrational. 
Even the simplest geometric fractals 
 have "impossible and irrational" 
 properties such as finite area inside
 an infinite diameter.
And if basic math isn't real enough,
 formation of clouds, trees,
 every cell in a human body, etc,
 all are measurable fractals
 that cannot be rationalized
 and they all *measurably* transcend
 their own geometries
 of space and time
 (this is the basis of chaos theory).

Perhaps all of the above is a
 deceitful illusion and a circle
 is secretly rational,
 and God's being fits within
 human rationality,
 and His will must conform to our rationality
 (even though God is a spirit and
 the author of space and time and logic itself,
 and who rejoices over a single sinner
 who is redeemed) -or- maybe Calvin was wrong.
