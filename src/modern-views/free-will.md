# Free Will

Foreknowledge != Predestination 

Synergy vs Monergism

Either Calvin and the reformers were wrong,
 or John Chrysostom and the church fathers
 were wrong.
This parallels a 7th century debate
 concerning monothelitism
 (Christ had only divine will)
 vs
 bitheletism
 (Christ had human AND divine will).


## Why this matters?
Soteriology and Christology

And general sense making


God's ultimate sovereignty
vs
God's love for mankind 

 


Double predestination


Limits of Rationality

We cannot reason or fit God within the bounds
 of rationality.

What we can reason about?
What we cannot reason about?


Total Free Will
vs
Total Predestination


Love and Free Will


Man created in the image and likeness of God

TULIP,
It starts, necessarily, with
 unconditional election and flows
 logically from one to the next




Rational supremacy



Can one believe they lack free will?
Is it even possible?

It's easy to say, but like a denial of
 [truth](../truth.md)
 it is self refuting and leads to absurdity.

Either God's sovereignty requires absurd
 conclusions for human consciousness,
 or God's divine love grants us free will
 to chose to worship and glorify Him.
By falling away from Him,
 we become the playthings of demons,
 no longer able to exercise our
 God-given will.


Who are you to classify God within rationality?

How to make sense of demons?
That is, if no free will, then why torment?
Why pull the unekect further from God?
Why not save everyone? Or make salvation available
 to all, even those you know won't be saved?







## What would change my mind?

Truth revealed by God.
