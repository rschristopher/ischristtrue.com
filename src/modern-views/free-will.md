# Free Will

For better or worse, the question of
 *free will* continues to be a
 perplexing and unanswered question
 for all people across all worldviews.
Whether religious or mechanistic,
 spiritual or rationalistic,
 none have ever received a clear
 answer to the question of human free will.
Many answers are available, but none
 have reached consensus even within
 the narrow bounds of their own worldview,
 let alone a universally accepted answer amongst all worldviews.

Pick one of these answers and you'll find schisms with two or more camps debating the issue.
There will be those that deny any notion
 of human free will
 (leaving man to a kind of fatalism),
 and there will be those that affirm man's
 absolute and total freedom.
And of course there will be plenty in between (from nuanced interpretations to various slippery slope arguments).
Pick any era in history in any culture
 and in any worldview and you will
 find this exact pattern 
 (albeit framed within the lexicon
 of the specific worldview).



## Christian Views

Christians (in all the various
 denominations) have debated
 this topic from the first century to the present day.
They'll refer to *predestination*
 and often redefine *free will* to fit
 their nuanced theological interpretations.
Yet even within the subtle nuances of
 the Greek word 
 [synergoi](https://crosstheology.wordpress.com/synergism/)
 the core debate rages on.
And if we detour back to our
 pre-Christian history, this exact 
 question of free will and
 predestination is what
 [divided the
 Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes](https://classicalchristianity.com/2011/02/15/on-predestination/).

One of the earliest Christian free will
 debates was the
 [Pelagian Controversy](https://tabletalkmagazine.com/article/2020/09/augustine-and-the-pelagian-controversy/).
And despite the conventional wisdom that 
 [St. Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Augustine)
 was reacting to the writings of
 Pelagius, the opposite was true.
Augustine's own writings were the catalyst
 that birthed a *reaction* known as
 [Pelagianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelagianism),
 a conflict which has arguably persisted through
 the ages and follows the aforementioned pattern
 of a schism over free will.
The *Pelagians* reacted to the perceived lack
 of free will within
 St. Augustine's writings --
 this reaction pushed into anti-Biblical views
 (that original sin did not taint human nature)
 in order to allow for human free will.
The Pelagian view
 was deemed heretic
 (see Canon V from the [Council of 418](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Councils_of_Carthage)).
However, the debate continued afterwards into various
 [semi-Pelagian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Pelagianism) views.

From these ongoing free will debates,
 [synergism](https://crosstheology.wordpress.com/synergism/)
 became the agreed upon solution by *orthodox* Christians.
This view was reinforced in the
 [fourth ecumenical council](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Fourth_Ecumenical_Council)
 determining that the person of Christ
 has *both* a human and divine will,
 that Christ is both God and man --
 a view that was further reinforced in the
 [sixth ecumenical council](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Sixth_Ecumenical_Council).
As time went on, this orthodox view of synergism 
 has occasionally drifted, often times
 with deliberate misrepresentations
 into semi-Pelagian views,
 resulting in renewed free-will debates amongst Christians
 that parallel the debates in the early church history.
For example,
 reformed theologians continue to debate this exact topic, resulting in
 [Arminianism vs Monergism](https://www.monergism.com/arminianisms), 
 which mimics the centuries old semi-Pelagian debates,
 including nuanced in-between views such as
 [Molinism](https://www.thoughtstheological.com/calvinism-molinism-arminianism-and-open-theism-monergismsynergism-at-the-macro-and-micro-levels/).




### Synergism and Monergism

As if to parallel the early Pelagian controversy,
 Arminianism arose as a *reaction* to the writings of 
 [John Calvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin)
 who was heavily influenced by 
 the writings of St. Augustine 
 on predestination.
The Arminian reaction was especially concerned with Calvin's views of
 *reprobation*
 (or what is otherwise known as 
  [double predestination](https://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/346cal2.html)),
 which is a logical conclusion to the denial of human free will,
 that the non-elect were effectively chosen for damnation
 (that God "adjudges others to eternal death").
These strict Calvinist views are known as
 [monergism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monergism).
The reaction came from the writings of
 [Jacobus Arminius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_Arminius)
 whose views led (inevitably) to a schism
 within the Calvinist churches, such that the
 [Remonstrant Brotherhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remonstrants)
 split from the Dutch Reformed Church.

The Remonstrant Arminian view was explicitly condemed
 at the 
 [Synod of Dort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synod_of_Dort)
 which is what led to the articulation of the
 [five points of Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism#Five_Points_of_Calvinism)
 (known by the mmnemonic acronym TULIP).
And exactly like the emergence of semi-Pelagianism,
 there inevitably arose rationalistic Arminianism, many of these views are
 superficially similar to the orthodox view of synergism.
What followed in the century after Dort was a
 migration away from strict Calvinism but not
 stopping at Arminianism, instead leading inevitably towards
 [deism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism),
 itself a stepping stone into the postmodern
 malaise and meaning crisis.
As a result, and as astute Calvinists have maintained,
 any view that takes away from the complete
 sovereignty of God inevitably leads to 
 deism, naturalism, and ultiamtely to what
 [Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche),
 described as the effective death of God
 in the hearts of men.

Slippery slope arguments aside,
 while we can easily dispense with the semi-Pelagian
 views of Remonstrant Arminianism,
 we are left with an ongoing
 debate between 
 monergism
 and
 orthodox synergism.
Ultimately, either John Calvin and the reformers were wrong,
 or John Chrysostom and the church fathers were wrong.
And while both sides have plenty of scriptural support, all it takes is one counterexample to show an interpretation as false.


### TODO

"The decree of reprobation cannot be made an object of prayer or preaching, and this is an argument against it. Experience confirms election, but repudiates reprobation."
https://classicalchristianity.com/2011/03/14/on-irrestible-grace-and-synergy/

https://classicalchristianity.com/2011/03/29/on-the-perseverance-of-the-saints/

As such, it would be fair to 
 see Arminianism as a Calvinist
 dressing around rationalistic synergism, which
 can lead to semi-pelegianism and deism.
Yet the culprit, the cause, is the rigid
 views of reprobation in Calvinism, that is, 
 ignoring the infinite love and mercy
 of God, and focusing too much on a
 rationalistic system, will inevitably
 create rationalistic Arminianism.

How does EO avoid the dangers of
 synergism? Do they?
What about Catholicism?

### Why this Matters?

Soteriology and Christology

And general sense making


God's ultimate sovereignty
vs
God's love for mankind




### Weakness in Synergism

Risks of semi-pelegianism, pelegianism more generally, and even deism -- a slippery slope into the horrors of the postmodern "enlightenment" that denies God, truth, morality, and any defensible epistemology -- leaving man devoured and disintegrated into the dark waters of chaos, unable to justify any such thing as goodness or even hope.



### Weakness in Monergism

Doubting God's love for all mankind.
Asserting that Christ died only for the sins of the elect.
Not participating willfully in your own salvation.
The unelect are predestined to hell with no chance of salvation.

 impossible to act within

 
 imposing limits on God based on rationality.

Influence of Platonism / Hellenism applied to the Bible (hence prevalent in the west in exactly those areas most
influenced by Platonism)

And most critically, monergism begets its own antithesis, which in turn begets a classic revolutionary and reactionary cycle. A cycle that only Christ can successfully resolve as mediator.

To the degree the reactionary revolutions produce revealed truth they can be said to be good (as all truth is), but to the degree they create schisms and deception, including bad faith arguments and misrepresentations of the opposing view; this is the work of the adversary, the bad fruits of demonic influence.


## Revolution and Reaction

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anatomy_of_Revolution

Resolving the dilemma requires Christ.

The revealed truth is the unification of the truths of monergism acted out in the truths of synergism. Traditionally this is what is meant by synergism, and is what St. Paul referenced by synergoi.







## Predestination

The Biblical narrative is very clear
 on two points:

*1 - God has ultimate sovereignty*, and

*2 - man has free will*.

The structure of the Biblical narrative
 affirms both points.
God is a character in the
 Bible, as is man,
 who was created in the image
 and likeness of God.
This is not an impersonal God of deism.
God is not only personal, but our very
 notion of personhood is from God,
 that is, we possess personhood because
 we were made in His image and likeness.
Our free will exists in that we
 participate in His will.
And His will is done. 
He is the transcendent source of all creation.
Even God hardening (strengthening)
 Pharoah's heart, 
 this is what allowed Pharoah
 to follow his own free will against
 certain destruction.

These two revealed truths, of God's sovereignty and man's free will, create a potential dilemma, as effectively both sides of the *free will* debate are strongly affirmed in the Bible. And thus any interpretation of scripture which denies one side can be declared false. And the question of reconciling these seemingly contrary views is left as a divine mystery, one that parallels the life and character of Jesus Christ.

This in effect is affirmed in the
Chalcedonian Definition
 from the
 ([fourth ecumenical council](https://orthodoxwiki.org/Fourth_Ecumenical_Council))
that Christ has two wills and
that Christ is both God and man.
This necessarily implies that man's free
 will not only exists but that it
 can be redeemed in Christ.
Note also how the human will of Christ
 participates in the will of the father,
 with obedience so as to glorify God (the father).
By coming to Christ we find in Christ
 an answer to the free will 
 question;
 and we find affirmation that any interpretation
 that denies or compromises free will or that denies or compromises God's ultimate sovereignty, any such views are as heretical and false as denying that Christ is both God and man.
Only by affirming that Christ is both God and man, such that man is both free and completely subject to God's sovereignty can we make sense of the Bible.
This is what is traditionally known as
 synergism
 from the Greek synergoi, as Saint Paul writes,

!!! quote "1 Corinthians 3:9"
    Θεοῦ γάρ ἐσμεν **συνεργοί**· Θεοῦ γεώργιον, Θεοῦ οἰκοδομή ἐστε.
    
    Theou gar esmen **synergoi**; Theou geôrgion, Theou oecodomê este.
    
    For we are **fellow workers** with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.

Foreknowledge != Predestination






## Love and Free Will

Man cannot fathom omniscience nor the nature
 of God's will, His divine judgement,
 His divine mercy,
 His divine love, nor any of His
 transcendent characteristics;
 and while all will one day be revealed,
 it is foolish to force God into
 logical constraints, as if to tell
 the creator of the universe what His
 timeless essence must be,
 what His omniscience
 must mean.

Does God will His creatures to hell and
 only save the elect according to his will?
Logically, His omniscience and divine
 will mean exactly that.
And yet, His divine mercy and love
 are for all of creation, even
 the most wretched of sinners.

What is human will if not an aspect
 of His divine will?
What has been revealed is that all, as in *all*,
 are so loved that He gave His only son.

The unelect, these are His children,
 they suffer without Him, and He calls to them,
 and the angels rejoice when one is saved.
Are they predestined to hell?
Is saying *no* to this a slight to His
 sovereignty and omniscience?
Is saying *yes* to this a slight to His
 love and mercy?

God calls us to participate in this His will, and thus we have free will sufficient to sin, sufficient to deny God.


Man created in the image and likeness of God




Can one believe they lack free will?
Is it even possible?

It's easy to say, but like a denial of
 [truth](../truth.md)
 it is self refuting and leads to absurdity.

Either God's sovereignty requires absurd
 conclusions for human consciousness,
 or God's divine love grants us free will
 to chose to worship and glorify Him,
 to participate in His will, or not.
By falling away from Him,
 we become the playthings of demons,
 no longer able to exercise our
 God-given will.


Who are you to classify God within rationality?

How to make sense of angels?
How to make sense of demons?
That is, if no free will, then why torment?
Why pull the unelect further from God?
Why not save everyone? Or make salvation available
 to all, even those you know won't be saved?







## What would change my mind?

Truth revealed by God.
