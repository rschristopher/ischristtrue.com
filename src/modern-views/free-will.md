# Free Will

For better or worse, the question of
 free will continues to be a
 perplexing and unanswered question
 for all people across all worldviews.
Whether religious or mechanistic,
 spiritual or rationalistic,
 none have ever received a clear
 answer to the question of human free will.
Many answers are available, but none
 have reached consensus even within
 the narrow bounds of any given worldview.
If you try, you'll likely find schisms with two or more camps debating the issue.
There will be those that deny any notion
 of human free will
 (leaving man to a kind of fatalism),
 and there will be those that affirm man's
 absolute and total freedom.
And of course there will be plenty in between (from nuanced interpretations to various slippery slope slopes).
Pick any era in history in any culture
 and in any worldview and you will
 find this exact pattern 
 (albeit framed within the lexicon
 of that worldview).

Even Christians (in all the various
 denominations) continue to debate
 this topic.
They'll refer to *predestination*
 and often redefine *free will* to fit
 their nuanced theological interpretations.
Yet even within the subtle nuances of
 the Greek word 
 [synergoi](https://crosstheology.wordpress.com/synergism/)
 the core debate rages on.
For example,
 Calvinists debate this topic between
 themselves, resulting in
 [Arminianism vs Monergism](https://www.monergism.com/arminianisms), 
 and 
 [Molinism](https://www.thoughtstheological.com/calvinism-molinism-arminianism-and-open-theism-monergismsynergism-at-the-macro-and-micro-levels/)
 as the nuanced in-between.
And if we detour back to our
 pre-Christian history, this exact 
 question of free will and
 predestination
 [divided the
 Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes](https://classicalchristianity.com/2011/02/15/on-predestination/).


## Predestination

The Biblical narrative is very clear
 on two points:
 *1 - God has ultimate sovereignty*
 and
 *2 - man has free will*.
The structure of the Biblical narrative
 affirms both points.
God is a character in the
 Biblical narrative, as is man.
This is not an impersonal God of deism.
God is not only personal, our very
 notion of personhood points to God,
 that is, we have personhood because
 we were made in His image and likeness.
Our free will exists in that we
 participate in His will.
Even God hardening (strengthening)
 Pharoah's heart, it allowed Pharoah
 to follow his own will against
 certain destruction.



Foreknowledge != Predestination 




Synergy vs Monergism

best take: Arminianism is a Calvinist
 dressing around rational synergism, which
 can lead to semi-pelegianism and deism.
Yet the culprit, the cause, is the rigid
 TULIP ideas of Calvinism, that is, 
 ignoring the infinite love and mercy
 of God, and focusing too much on a
 rationalistic system, will inevitably
 create rational Arminianism.

Pelegianism was deemed heretical in 418

How does EO avoid the dangers of
 synergism? Do they?
What about Catholicism?

Double predestination?

Either John Calvin and the reformers were wrong,
 or John Chrysostom and the church fathers
 were wrong.
This parallels a 7th century debate
 concerning monothelitism
 (Christ had only divine will)
 vs
 bitheletism
 (Christ had human AND divine will).

"The decree of reprobation cannot be made an object of prayer or preaching, and this is an argument against it. Experience confirms election, but repudiates reprobation."

## Why this Matters?
Soteriology and Christology

And general sense making


God's ultimate sovereignty
vs
God's love for mankind




### Weakness in Synergism

Doubting God's absolute sovereignty,
 doubting God's omniscience.

Risks of semi-pelegianism, pelegianism more generally, and even deism -- a slippery slope into the horrors of the postmodern "enlightenment" that denies God, truth, morality, and any defensible epistemology -- leaving man devoured and disintegrated into the dark waters of chaos, unable to justify any such thing as goodness or even hope.



### Weakness in Monergism

Doubting God's love for all mankind,
 Christ dying only for the sins of the elect,
 not participating willfully in your own salvation,
 predestined to hell with no chance of salvation,
 impossible to act within,
 imposing limits on God based on rationality.

Influence of Platonism / Hellenism applied to the Bible (hence prevalent in the west in exactly those areas most
influenced by Platonism)



## Limits of Rationality

We cannot reason or fit God within the bounds
 of rationality.

What we can reason about?
What we cannot reason about?


Total Free Will
vs
Total Predestination




### Love and Free Will

Man cannot fathom omniscience nor the nature
 of God's will, His divine judgement,
 His divine mercy,
 His divine love, nor any of His
 transcendent characteristics;
 and while all will one day be revealed,
 it seems foolish to force God into
 logical constraints, as if to tell
 the creator of the universe what His
 timeless essence must be,
 what His omniscience
 must mean.

Does God will His creatures to hell and
 only save the elect according to his will?
Logically, His omniscience and divine
 will mean exactly that.
And yet, His divine mercy and love
 are for all of creation, even
 the most wretched of sinners.

What is human will if not an aspect
 of His divine will?
What has been revealed is that all, as in all,
 are so loved that He gave His only son.

The unelect, these are His children,
 they suffer without Him, and He calls to them,
 and the angels rejoice when one is saved.
Are they predestined to hell?
Is saying *no* to this a slight to His
 sovereignty and omniscience?
Is saying *yes* to this a slight to His
 love and mercy?



Man created in the image and likeness of God

TULIP,
It starts, necessarily, with
 unconditional election and flows
 logically from one to the next

Total depravity

Unconditional election




Rational supremacy



Can one believe they lack free will?
Is it even possible?

It's easy to say, but like a denial of
 [truth](../truth.md)
 it is self refuting and leads to absurdity.

Either God's sovereignty requires absurd
 conclusions for human consciousness,
 or God's divine love grants us free will
 to chose to worship and glorify Him,
 to participate in His will, or not.
By falling away from Him,
 we become the playthings of demons,
 no longer able to exercise our
 God-given will.


Who are you to classify God within rationality?

How to make sense of angels?
How to make sense of demons?
That is, if no free will, then why torment?
Why pull the unelect further from God?
Why not save everyone? Or make salvation available
 to all, even those you know won't be saved?







## What would change my mind?

Truth revealed by God.
